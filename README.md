# News Annotation Platform 

This is a browser-based annotation platform for labeling persuasive propaganda, inflammatory language, and misleading content in news articles. Designed for MTurk and human-subject studies.

## Location: 
/mturkstudy/src/website_management

## 🚀 Features

- Highlight text and apply structured labels
- Customizable categories and survey questions
- Supports article-by-article surveys
- JSON export or Firebase integration
- “Thank You” screen with MTurk code

## 🔧 Customization via `config.js`

To adapt the tool for your own study, edit `config.js`:

- `articles`: your article text and titles
- `categoryOptions`: tags available to annotators
- `surveyQuestions`: Likert-style post-annotation questions

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Update `config.js`
4. Run locally: `npm start`
5. Optionally deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase

## 📂 Example Output

At the end of the task, all annotations and survey responses are saved as structured JSON and can optionally be uploaded to Firebase.

## 🧪 Designed For Research

This tool was created for a human-subject study but is reusable across research domains involving:
- Misinformation
- Bias detection
- Media literacy
