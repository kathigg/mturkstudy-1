Democrat Robert Martwick sworn in as state senator; GOP taps Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens for House seat,"Jun. 29--Two familiar names will be taking on new roles representing residents of the Northwest Side and near northwest suburbs in Springfield. Robert Martwick, a Chicago Democrat who's served in the Illinois House since 2013, was sworn in Friday afternoon as the new state senator for the 10th District. Local Democratic committeemen, including Martwick himself, selected him to replace former Sen. John Mulroe, a Chicago Democrat who stepped down earlier this month after being appointed a Cook County judge. Local Republican leaders met Saturday to name Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens to a House seat vacated by Michael McAuliffe, who had been the lone GOP state lawmaker from Chicago. McAuliffe retired June 17 after 23 years in the legislature. His father, Roger McAuliffe, held the seat for 23 years before that. Stephens, the son of longtime Rosemont Mayor Donald Stephens, was sworn in by Mulroe. Stephens said Friday that he will continue serving as mayor and will collect his legislative salary of more than $69,000 on top of his $260,000 mayoral salary. He said he will comply with a state law prohibiting local officials from being paid by local governments for the time they're in session in Springfield. Stephens, who will represent roughly the western half of Martwick's Senate district, said he already has good working relationships with the new senator and other lawmakers. ""Over the past 12 years as the mayor, I've made several trips to the Capitol to forge relationships with members on both sides of the aisle,"" Stephens said. He said believes he'll be able to find common ground on some issues with the Democrats who control the legislature. House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs welcomed Stephens to the House. ""Brad Stephens will be able to deliver for his district on day one,"" Durkin said Saturday in a statement. ""His deep knowledge of state policy and its impact on local communities will be valuable to the Illinois state legislature and a welcome addition to the House Republican Caucus."" Martwick this spring shepherded one of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker's signature initiatives -- a proposed amendment to do away with the Illinois Constitution's flat-rate income tax mandate -- through the House. The measure will appear on the November 2020 ballot, when Martwick said he plans to seek a full term in the Senate. In the Senate, Martwick will continue pushing for legislation to create an elected school board in Chicago, he said. The House approved a bill he sponsored with broad bipartisan support in April, but it was put on hold in the Senate in deference to new Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who called the proposal for a 21-member board ""unwieldy."" Martwick said he's yet to met with Lightfoot to discuss the issue. ""I look forward to sitting down with her and having a conversation in earnest,"" he said. Stephens said he also plans to seek a full term in 2020, but Democrats will likely have their eyes on the seat as well. Though McAuliffe ran unopposed last year, his reelection race against Democrat Merry Marwig in 2016 was one of the most expensive state legislative campaigns in the country. ""We will do whatever it takes to win,"" Stephens said. In addition to looking for potential candidates to challenge Stephens next year, Democratic leaders also must select Martwick's replacement in the House. Among the potential candidates are former 45th Ward Ald. John Arena and former WGN-AM 720 host Patti Vasquez. Martwick has not yet backed a successor. dpetrella@chicagotribune.com ___ (c)2019 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Chicago Tribune,center
"Frozen sperm bank could be set up in space, study suggests","Sperm banks could one day be set up in space, scientists have predicted. Frozen samples that were exposed to microgravity conditions and those kept in normal conditions appear to keep similar characteristics, according to the results of a small study, the Press Association has reported. The results of the research suggest frozen sperm could be sent into space and ""open the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth"". But more research is needed to fully understand the effect of space conditions, scientists have said. The study was presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria. The scientists conducting the study said little is known about the effect of different gravity levels on sperm. Dr Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women's Health in Barcelona, said: ""Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of human fresh sperm sample. ""But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space."" The researchers used sperm from 10 healthy donors, exposing some of the samples to microgravity using a small aerobatic aircraft. The samples were then analyzed for concentration, motility and DNA fragmentation - tests which are all performed to check for fertility. No significant differences were found between the samples kept on the ground and those exposed to microgravity, according to the study. ""The lack of differences observed in the sperm characteristics between frozen samples exposed to microgravity and those maintained in ground conditions open the possibility of safely transporting male gametes to space and considering the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth,"" the researchers said. However they added that this is a preliminary study, and they need to validate their findings with more samples and expose the sperm to space-like conditions for longer periods of time. ""Our best option will be to perform the experiment using real spaceflight but access is very limited,"" Dr Boada said.",science,Press Association,center
phoenix chief says police response to incident with 4-year-old is 'unacceptable',"Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams apologized for her department's handling of an alleged shoplifting incident involving a 4-year-old girl and her parents , saying Sunday the confrontation that was captured on video was ""unacceptable."" ""What we saw in that video isn't in keeping with good policing,"" Williams said in an interview with NBC affiliate KPNX . ""This is not what should have happened in that circumstance."" The child's parents, Dravon Ames and Iesha Harper, filed notice of a $10 million claim last week over the incident, which occurred on May 29 after the couple said they realized their daughter had taken a doll from a dollar store. Video showed officers appearing to push and kick a handcuffed man believed to be Ames and handcuffing Harper, who is pregnant, after an unidentified woman came to take care of the couples' two young daughters. At one point, an officer screams at Ames and says: """"When I tell you to do something, you f------ do it!"" The officers then pick up Ames   who apologizes and appears to be complying   and throws him against a police vehicle. The couple and authorities offered different accounts of what happened before the confrontation. Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to ""adults"" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something. Once the car was parked, the report says, Ames allegedly reached toward the car's center console and yelled that he hadn't done anything wrong. Williams said Sunday that police ""shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted."" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. ""I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,"" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. ""I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes. I thought they were gonna start shooting,"" he said. Rev. Jarrett Maupin, of the Arizona chapter of the National Action Network, appeared with Ames on MSNBC, saying that ""this is one of the most insane attacks on a black family, or any family, that I've ever seen law enforcement engage in."" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego issued a statement on Twitter Saturday saying about the incident, saying, ""I, like many others, am sick over what I have seen in the video"" and ""I am deeply sorry for what this family went through."" The mayor vowed to speed up implementation of body cameras on police officers and hold a community meeting to address the incident. ""I realize that to get to the bottom of this issue and implement meaningful change, we are going to have some uncomfortable and painful conversations,"" Gallego said.",crime,CNN,left
"Four top residencies now offered to local artists, thanks to Oolite","Miami artists have a new opportunity to superpower their careers. Thanks to the Miami-based nonprofit Oolite Arts, four prestigious programs   Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Atlantic Center for the Arts, the Rauschenberg Foundation and Yaddo   will open their residencies to South Florida artists. Oolite   formerly known as ArtCenter South Florida   will pay stipends, tuition and travel expenses under a new program, Home and Away. ""Residencies can be a defining moment in an artist's career, offering them the time and space to experiment, in addition to creating the connections that can lead to important exhibitions and opportunities,"" said Dennis Scholl, Oolite Arts' president and CEO, in a statement. ""We hope our artists will return to South Florida with new ideas and relationships that will further enrich their own work, and Miami's cultural community."" Applications for the Anderson Ranch residency will be accepted between July 10 and Aug. 13 at oolitearts.org/homeandaway. Details about the other residencies will become available later this year. Each residency comes with different benefits and requirements. At Anderson Ranch, a dozen Miami artists will work and meet with master curators and artists in five-week residencies beginning in February 2020. Also next spring, Oolite will take a dozen Miami artists to Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach for a weeklong residency. Artists will be chosen by a jury of local curators. One Miami artist will be chosen by jury to participate in the Rauschenberg Foundation residency at the late Robert Rauschenberg's former home in Captiva. Oolite will also support expenses for Miami artists chosen for the highly competitive Yaddo residency in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ""Our Miami working artists are elevating their practice to a point that many of them can successfully compete for and be awarded these kinds of prestigious residencies,"" said Scholl in an interview. ""But one of the biggest issues is the economics of going off the grid for five weeks. We need to help artists pay their rent at home while they're gone.""     ©2019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Miami Herald,left
port of l.a. sued after canceling agreement for a shipping container facility,"A Los Angeles company is suing the Port of L.A., claiming it improperly terminated an agreement to negotiate the development of a $130 million container facility at the harbor. The termination came after the company couldn't secure support for the project from the union representing dockworkers, according to the lawsuit. In a 15-page complaint filed this week in L.A. Superior Court, Harbor Performance Enhancement Center claims that it spent four years and more than $2 million on its planned facility at Terminal Island. Shipping containers were to be stored and accessed at the site, using a ""hub and spoke"" model that would ultimately ease congestion at the port. Port officials supported the project, according to the lawsuit, and granted the company an exclusive negotiating agreement. However, last month, Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of L.A., told the company that the facility was ""infeasible."" Seroka didn't provide a reason for ending the agreement, the lawsuit states. The Board of Harbor Commissioners, who are appointed by Mayor Eric Garcetti, and the Los Angeles City Council didn't weigh in on the decision, which the company claims was necessary to validate it. The lawsuit names the Port of L.A., the Board of Harbor Commissioners and the city of L.A., and asks a judge to overturn the decision. A port spokesman declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The company's lawsuit states it started working with the port on the proposed facility in 2015. It received a permit for a pilot study, conducted an environmental review on the site and secured $130 million in financing. In 2018, Seroka told the company it also needed to get support from International Longshore and Warehouse Union, or ILWU, for the project to proceed, according to the lawsuit. The union represents more than 10,000 workers at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The company would have to guarantee to grant the union jurisdiction and exclusive rights to provide trucking services,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Rather than help mediate with the ILWU or insist that the ILWU negotiate in good faith, Executive Director Seroka, in April 2018, advised petitioners in writing that they must accommodate the ILWU's demands because 'they [ILWU] run the Port,'"" the suit states. On May 10 of this year, Seroka sent a letter to the company stating that the port was terminating its agreement. The company claims it was ""continually rebuffed"" by union representatives during discussions over the project, the lawsuit states. Jonathan Rosenthal, chief executive of Harbor Performance Enhancement Center, said in a statement to The Times that the requirements with the union were an ""unexpected curveball thrown at us."" ""Beyond the time and money we've spent, it makes me worried for the city when a green, job-creating project is stymied by a single entity for their own narrow reasons, and none of our decision makers will step in to try to resolve it,"" Rosenthal said. Leaders of the local chapter of the ILWU didn't respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit comes amid another battle at the port. The Board of Harbor Commissioners voted Thursday to approve a permit for driverless cargo handlers to operate inside a facility over the objections of the dockworkers. Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents the harbor region, said he plans to ask the council to veto the project. The container shipping company that won that permit , Maersk, has declined to say how many jobs would be affected. Times staff writer Margot Roosevelt contributed to this report. dakota.smith@latimes.com Twitter: @dakotacdsmith",science,CNN Business,left

"south african woman reunited with son six years after he disappeared and was tracked down 1,000 miles away","The pictures and footage only scratch the surface of the tale: wide smiles, and the tears of joy of a mother and her son, reunited after six years. Six years ago, Jane Daniels, 60, from Delft, near Cape Town, South Africa , was distraught when her son, who is mentally challenged, disappeared. When the police came up with no leads, after three years, Denzil was presumed dead, and a memorial service was held. But two weeks ago, police in the neighboring country of Eswatini, formerly called Swaziland, carried out a routine stop and search of a man who was found rummaging through trash outside a supermarket. He gave them an address in Delft   the Daniels' home. The Eswatini police sent a photo of Denzil to the Cape police missing persons' unit, and Warrant Officer Michael Daniels   no relation   took it to Mrs. Daniels and asked her if she knew the man in the photo. BODY OF KENYAN STOWAWAY FOUND IN LONDON YARD AFTER FALLING FROM PLANE'S LANDING GEAR Officer Daniels didn't expect the reaction he received. ""My heart is going out for her. We should help this woman, because when we brought the news to say your child is in Swaziland, she just fainted,"" he said. But Mrs. Daniels couldn't afford to make the 2,200-mile round trip to collect her son, now 30, who was being looked after by the Eswatini police. Fortunately, radio and multimedia journalist Lauren Isaacs of South Africa's Eye Witness News ( EWN ) came to the rescue. A Delft pastor appealed to Isaacs for help, and the reporter visited the mother. ""I saw the desperation on her, and her poor circumstances.,"" Isaacs told Fox News. ""For three days I called businesses begging for money"". ""In 90% of missing persons cases, it doesn't end well. It gets to us, I needed to get help for this family.""

There are no direct road transport links between Eswatini and Cape Town. So Warrant Officer Daniels and a police colleague took vacation time, and used the policeman's private car for the two-day journey to reunite mother and son at the border. On seeing her son, Jane repeatedly hugged him and kept saying: ""My son, my son, I am so happy to see you."" Denzil for his part said he had hitchhiked to Eswatini where he made friends and did odd jobs to make a living. ""I helped people to earn some money, selling clothes and stuff like that... I missed my family."" He later explained to News24.com : ""I wasn't actually going to Swaziland. I was in Wellington and then I moved further and further.""

Ex-Posen mayor pleads guilty to embezzling village funds,"The former mayor of Posen pleaded guilty Thursday to embezzling $27,000 from village coffers during his final term in office. Donald Schupek, 79, who served three terms as mayor of the south suburb before losing a reelection bid in 2017, admitted under oath that in 2015 he had drawn checks on the village's bank account to give himself payroll advances that he never intended to deduct from future paychecks or repay. Prosecutors, who allege Schupek used the ill-gotten gains to gamble at casinos in Joliet, recommended a prison sentence of six and 12 months for the former mayor, who is in poor health and appeared in court Thursday using a wheelchair. By statute, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman can sentence Schupek to as many as 10 years behind bars but the former mayor's attorney said he expects the judge to impose a much lighter sentence, possibly probation. Schupek declined comment outside the courtroom Thursday after entering his guilty plea. His attorney Domingo Vargas said Schupek, who was federally indicted in January, entered the plea due to the facts of the case and his health situation. ""He'd like to put this behind him,"" Vargas said. ""He has more important issues to deal with in his life."" Vargas said his client had offered no explanation for the embezzlement, but had expressed remorse for his theft and planned to pay full restitution in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence. Schupek is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 12. Posen's current mayor Frank Podbielniak did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schupek. Podbielniak said at the time of Schupek's arrest in January that he learned of possible embezzlement shortly after taking office in May 2017 and immediately reported it the FBI. Schupek is the second ex-Posen mayor who has pleaded guilty to stealing from the village in the past two-plus decades. In 1997, former Posen Mayor James Adamek Jr. pleaded guilty to stealing more than $180,000 from the village over 14 months and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. zkoeske@tribpub.com Twitter @ZakKoeske",crime,Chicago Tribune,center
rosemount recreation center plan gets positive response so far,"While a study on whether to proceed with a new recreation center in Rosemount continues, early results are mostly positive. In September, the Rosemount City Council hired a consultant to study the necessity of a center and how it could be funded. At a recent meeting, council members got a look at some of the early research as well as a potential design. ""We're getting a lot of feedback, most of it seems pretty positive,"" said Dan Schultz, the city's parks and recreation director. The survey is 85 percent done and should be completed in the next few weeks. The potential center would provide a place for the community to gather in recreation and wellness, according to 292 Design Group, the company selected to design it. The $28.9 million project would spread out over 87,000 square feet and feature gathering areas and office space as well as athletic facilities. WHY BUILD A REC CENTER The number of people taking part in area recreation and leisure activities is growing and there is a desire for more fitness spaces, according to the survey. The population in the area is younger than the national average and there are more families with children, the survey has found. In Rosemount, 46.5 percent of households have children compared to the statewide average of 31.6 percent. ""There's needs for all ages so that would be something a facility could provide,"" Schultz said. The survey has also discovered the median household income is above average in the area. According to Schultz, this means the community has more resources to support and use the center. TENTATIVE PLAN The new recreation center would include a two-court gymnasium, two swimming pools, a locker room, an exercise area, indoor play equipment, office spaces, and a general gathering area, according to 292 Design Group. ""It reflects what was shared in meetings and at the public open house, what elements and spaces were necessary to support community activities,"" said Maria Manion, a designer with 292 Design Group. Its design will be made with potential expansion in mind. The costs so far do not cover the money needed to operate the facility once built. According to Schultz, it has still not been determined whether Rosemount or a private provider will fund and manage the center. ""We're still looking at those options. … We're not to that point yet to make that decision,"" he added WHAT COMES NEXT?

Ridgecrest earthquakes caused damage to the earth's crust seen from satellite,"Damage to the earth's crust from the 6.4 and 7.1 magnitude earthquakes that struck Southern California last week is visible in a kaleidoscopic satellite image released by NASA. The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, used satellite data to produce a map showing ruptures and displacements not visible to the naked eye   employing technology that has been developed over the last quarter century. The imagery was acquired on July 8 and compared with data from April 8. The earthquakes were the largest to hit California in nearly 20 years and were felt as far away as Phoenix and Mexicali, Mexico. The temblors and the thousands of aftershocks that followed did not lead to major structural damage near the Ridgecrest epicenter, but did have residents of nearby Trona, Calif.   worrying about their town's future. Authorities are investigating whether the death of a man 95 miles away in Pahrump, Nev., was tied to the earthquake. The man was pinned under a Jeep after the vehicle fell off its jacks following the quake. On the NASA map, each color of the psychedelic-looking image represents 4.8 inches of ground displacement. Linear color lines indicate where an area was cracked open or was disturbed. ""One of the things that we want to know after an earthquake happens is which fault moved and how far it moved. So, by using these satellite images, we can determine where the fault is, what lengths of the fault slipped in the earthquake and which fault moved the most. That allows us to better understand where future earthquakes could happen,"" said JPL's Eric Fielding. It once took a year to obtain such satellite images, as was the case when capturing the impact of the 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake in the Mojave Desert in 1992. But Fielding said that since 2016, images can arrive within three to four days. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency provided the data to produce the map. NASA is building its own radar satellite at JPL. When it launches in roughly three years, Fielding said, the technology will be able to ""map the whole Earth every 12 days."" colleen.shalby@latimes.com @cshalby",science,Los Angeles Times,left
Protest in Madrid as conservatives suspend ban on most polluting cars,"MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands protested in Madrid on Saturday against the suspension of curbs on polluting cars by the new conservative city hall, raising fears that environmental rollbacks seen in the United States may be spreading to Europe. The first reversal of environmental policies by a major European city comes despite soaring global environmental concerns and is a fresh sign of growing divisions in Spain after a series of inconclusive elections in April and May. Last November Madrid's then far-left government banned most petrol and diesel cars from its center to tackle high levels of nitrogen dioxide. The policy was known as ""Madrid central"" and it was intended to bring Madrid into line with EU clean air rules which it had been violating since 2010. ""Yes we can, I do want Madrid central,"" chanted the protesters. Some were holding banners that read ""I want to breathe free"" and ""We aspire to have a Madrid without smoke"". ""We have to save (the planet) starting at the local and small level, the first thing is Madrid's center,"" said Laura Martin, a 39-year-old actress. She added that she was concerned that the new Madrid government might have some similar ideas to U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of environmental policies, such as weakening rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants and standards on harmful gas emissions from cars and trucks. People of all ages rallied despite a scorching heatwave in Spain and most of Europe, which had already forced the city of Paris to ban more than half of all registered cars from its roads earlier this week because the heat worsens pollution. Various European cities including Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London and Oslo have started to penalize or ban older polluting cars as they seek to phase out all fossil fuel cars in the coming decade. Environmental groups including Greenpeace say the ""Madrid central"" measure slashed air pollution levels from car emissions in the center to record lows. The new city hall run by the conservative People's Party suspended fines on cars entering the currently restricted area of around five sq km (two sq miles) from July 1, while it reviews the plan to make it ""compatible with citizens' mobility needs"". ""As far as I know at the European level there's no precedent in ending a car traffic restriction,"" said Lara Lazaro, researcher of the Real Instituto Elcano. The European Commission has warned Spain that it would face sanctions and a possible lawsuit if it fails to meet air quality standards in its largest cities of Madrid and Barcelona.

Missouri's only abortion clinic to remain open after judge's injunction holds,"ST. LOUIS   Missouri's lone abortion clinic can still operate after a St. Louis judge on Friday kept an injunction in effect allowing it to perform the procedure. In the latest legal whiplash in the case, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was told minutes before a long-awaited court hearing began that the state health department had dealt it a blow, declining to renew its license. But State Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer ruled in favor of the embattled health center, preventing Missouri from becoming the only state in the country without an abortion clinic   temporarily, at least. ""Today is a victory for women to be able to access the kind of medical care that they and their health professionals need and deserve,"" said M'Evie Mead, director of policy and organizing at Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, which supports the two Planned Parenthood providers in the state, including one that no longer performs abortions. ""It is still very, very difficult to access abortion in Missouri because of medically unnecessary hoops and regulations, but you can still come to Planned Parenthood today for all of your reproductive health care,"" Mead said. ""And that is a good day for women."" Missouri's health department first decided not to renew the health center's abortion license as of June 1 after an inspection in March found problems, including ""at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised,"" ""failed surgical abortions in which women remained pregnant,"" and an alleged failure to obtain ""informed consent,"" the Associated Press reported. Stelzer granted a preliminary injunction to the clinic on June 10 that allowed it to continue to operate even as the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services refused to renew its license. He set a deadline of June 21 for the department to make a decision. Then, despite the health department not renewing the license, Stelzer said on Friday during a hearing that barely lasted five minutes that his previously issued injunction held. The long-term fate of the clinic remains unclear. Stelzer said he would issue a written order regarding next steps with the injunction as soon as possible, adding it ""won't necessarily come today."" Planned Parenthood has argued that the licensing battle is part of a greater anti-abortion effort by the state's administration. Last month, Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill banning abortions on or beyond the eighth week of pregnancy without exceptions in cases of rape or incest   one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bills. The clinic also says it made changes in response to the state's inspection and has consistently provided high-quality care. Its legal battle got even thornier this week when Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region announced it would no longer be complying with a rule from regulators mandating pelvic exams 72 hours before an abortion as well as on the day of the procedure, calling it another medically unnecessary requirement that the state was putting on it to whittle down Missouri residents' access to abortion. That stance is backed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , which calls multiple pelvic exams for women seeking abortion ""unwarranted."" Missouri is one of six states that has only one abortion clinic. The other five states are Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. Missouri had more abortion clinics in the past; in 2008, there were five. But in the past decade, the clinics were unable to keep up with the state's stringent and perpetually evolving requirements, with some closing and then reopening again and then shuttering for good. The licensing fight comes amid a slew of recent anti-abortion legislation across the country, including a near-total ban on abortions in Alabama. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to block the bans, which they say are unconstitutional under the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision that federally legalized abortion. Aaron Mermelstein reported from St. Louis, and Elizabeth Chuck from New York.",legal arguments,NBC News,left
"Philadelphia refinery workers sue over abrupt closure, layoffs","Two Philadelphia Energy Solutions employees have sued the company, alleging it failed to comply with city and federal laws before they were abruptly sacked last week after a devastating fire June 21 that crippled the South Philadelphia refinery. Nathan Rutkowski, of Westmont, N.J., and Martin Harper, of Media, Pa., filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia on Friday, alleging that PES failed to comply with federal and city Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Acts (WARN). Those laws require larger employees to give workers at least 60 days notice of a layoff, allowing them time to adjust and seek alternative jobs. The lawsuit seeks class action status, and was filed by Benjamin F. Johns, a partner with Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith LLP in Haverford. PES's 1,100 employees were told Wednesday that the company would close in early July because of damages sustained after the June 21 fire; some nonunion workers were discharged immediately, as of July 1. They were offered no severance. Most refinery workers initially learned of the closure from news reports followed by an announcement from Mayor Jim Kenney's office. ""Unfortunately, it was not feasible for PES to provide earlier notice because the business circumstances that followed the fire and explosion were not reasonably foreseeable,"" the company said in a notification to employees who lost their jobs, explaining why they were not given 60-day notices. The refinery has been financially struggling even before the fire and explosion prompted a decision to close. The lawsuit by the two employees, who are inspectors, alleges the company's failure to comply with the warning notices deprived them of ""some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment, to seek and obtain alternative jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will allow these workers to successfully compete in the job market."" ___ (c)2019 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,The Philadelphia Inquirer,left
the day the reds played a role in the women's suffrage moment,"If you enjoyed it when Sen. Kamala Harris went after former Vice President Joe Biden with surgical precision or got a kick out of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's articulating a plan for darn-near everything during the recent Democratic presidential debates, let this sink in. A century ago, these two candidates for President of the United States could not even have voted. It took more than 50 years of fighting for women to finally win the right to vote in 1920, which included rallies and marches, community organizing and, yes, baseball with a bit of sex appeal and home economics thrown in. That, according to research by Mary Anne Christie, of Madeira, vice chair of the Ohio Republican Women's Suffrage Committee. The group is spearheading Ohio's effort to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. With baseball? Yup. Christie will be on hand Saturday, July 6, as the Cincinnati Reds hold special events before and after their 4:10 p.m. game against the Cleveland Indians to honor the women of Ohio gaining the right to vote. Christie especially wants women and girls to respect the moment. ""I hope this is going to make them realize that it wasn't so long ago that they got the right to vote, that they are going to realize the time when their mothers and their grandmothers for the first time got a right to vote,"" she said. Saturday's event harkens to June 3, 1916, when the Reds played the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York. The suffragist moment was in full swing, and clearly, the women knew the value of product placement, considering baseball was the nation's most popular sport. Suffragist women mingled in the stands, wore blue, silk sashes and sold flags. The New York Times noted that some men paid more attention to the ladies than the game. They hung billboards all over the polo grounds with messages like, ""Let Women win the Vote in One Inning"" and ""Women Hate Coaching from the Sidelines."" A week before the game, suffragists negotiated with the Giants to offer a piece of chocolate cake for every ticket purchased at the suffrage headquarters to increase their share of ticket sales. In 2019, as part of the Reds-Indians game promotion, Kroger stores are selling chocolate cakes to recognize Ohio women's suffrage efforts for Saturday's game. And members of the committee will wear purple, white and gold sashes with the phrase, ""Votes for Women"" written on them. Today, women vote in higher numbers than men, 117 women were elected or appointed to Congress in 2018, and six are vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. ""Soccer Moms"" are a voting bloc. But before all that happened, the Women's Suffrage Movement had to succeed. Congress passed the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it 12 days later, but it took more than a year to fully approve the amendment when Tennessee became the 36th state to vote in favor of ratification in August 1920. It's difficult to fathom a time when only white males who owned land got to vote and make laws in the United States. That's an ugly American legacy mitigated by the ratification of the 19th Amendment and the many other changes that ensued over time. And to think, Reds baseball had a small hand in that.

Green iguana: Florida says kill them 'whenever possible',"Pardon the American iguanas residing in sunny Florida for not feeling very patriotic on this Fourth of July. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which protects crocodiles and places strict guidelines on hunting deer, has put the scaly, yardlong-or-more creature also known as the green iguana on its hit list. The commission issued a directive describing the green iguana as an invasive species, citing damage they wreak on seawalls, sidewalks and plants.

'Kill zone' prosecutions limited by California Supreme Court,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)   The California Supreme Court has limited ""kill zone"" prosecutions, where defendants are charged with the attempted murder of people near a crime scene regardless of whether they were targeted or injured. The justices unanimously decided Monday to overturn kill zone convictions against a gunman and an accomplice in an attack in San Bernardino, the Los Angeles Times reported. Both defendants were convicted in 2008 of one count of murder and the attempted murders of a rival gang member and a man who was attending a party where the shooting occurred. The court did not throw out the convictions involving the murder or the attempted murder of the rival but said in its decision the evidence did not support the conviction involving the bystander. The justices also cautioned trial judges to allow the ""kill zone"" theory sparingly in the future. The theory should be used only when there is evidence that a defendant had a specific intent to kill the target and ""everyone within the zone of fatal harm,"" Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye wrote for the court. The deputy attorney general who argued the case could not be reached for comment. One of the defense lawyers in the appeal estimated that hundreds of defendants in California have been convicted under the kill zone theory since it was adopted in 2002. Deciding whether a defendant can face such a prosecution will depend on the circumstances of the attack, including the type and extent of force used, and the location of the person who was not the primary target, the court said. ""Trial courts must be extremely careful in determining when to permit the jury to rely upon the kill zone theory,"" the court cautioned. The appeal was filed by Michael Canizales and KeAndre Windfield, who were tried before a single jury on the murder and attempted murder counts.. The trial court gave a kill zone instruction to the jury on the attempted murder charge involving Travion Bolden, a rival gang member who was with the target and who, like the target, was unharmed in the attack. The jury convicted both defendants of the attempted murder of Bolden, adding 15 years to life to their sentences. ""Even when a jury is otherwise properly instructed on circumstantial evidence and reasonable doubt,"" Cantil-Sakauye wrote, ""the potential for misapplication of the kill zone theory remains troubling.""",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
dominican republic tourist deaths: americans are more likely to be killed in the us than in the dr,"The recent spate of American tourist deaths after visiting the Dominican Republic might paint a grim picture of the Caribbean nation. But statistics show you're more likely to be killed in a homicide back home in the States than die of unnatural causes in the Dominican Republic. Here's a look at how many American tourists have died unnaturally in the tropical hotspot, and how that compares to other popular Caribbean destinations. US tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic have declined More than 2 million American tourists visited the Dominican Republic in each of the past two years, according to the Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association . Despite a 7.9% increase in US visitors between 2017 and 2018, the number of unnatural deaths has been dropping since 2015, according to statistics from the US State Department . In 2015, 30 Americans died of unnatural causes in the Dominican Republic . That number dropped to 18 in 2016; to 17 in 2017; and down to 13 in 2018 . In other words: The odds of a US visitor dying unnaturally in the Dominican Republic in 2017 was about 0.82 per 100,000. Those odds dropped even further last year to 0.58 unnatural deaths per 100,000 American visitors . Unnatural deaths include drownings, homicides and vehicle accidents The leading cause of unnatural death among Americans in the Dominican Republic is motor vehicle accidents, according to State Department statistics from 2014 to 2018. In those five years, 33 Americans died in motor vehicle accidents ; 25 Americans drowned; 20 were killed in homicides; and nine died by suicide. The State Department's data set does not include deaths of Americans from natural causes, such as heart attacks. The US has a much higher homicide rate The odds of an American dying by homicide in the Dominican Republic -- 0.19 per 100,000 in 2017 -- are far less than the odds of getting killed in a homicide back home. As of 2017, the rate of murders, homicides and non-negligent manslaughter in the US was 5.3 per 100,000 , according to the Pew Research Center , citing data from the FBI. In some US cities, the homicide rate is significantly higher -- about 66 per 100,000 people in St. Louis , 56 per 100,000 in Baltimore, 40 per 100,000 in Detroit, and 40 per 100,000 in New Orleans. Other Caribbean hot spots have higher unnatural death rates Recent circumstances surrounding some deaths in the Dominican Republic catapulted the country into the spotlight. But Jamaica and the Bahamas actually have higher rates of unnatural American deaths , State Department statistics show. In 2018, the rate of unnatural deaths of Americans in Jamaica was 1.04 per 100,000 . That's higher than in the Bahamas ( 0 .71 per 100,000 ) and the Dominican Republic ( 0.58 per 100,000 ). But just like in the Dominican Republic, homicides were not the leading cause of unnatural deaths in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Over the past five years, the leading cause of unnatural deaths among Americans in two of the countries was drowning ( 46 in the Bahamas , 30 in Jamaica). It was auto vehicle accidents in the Dominican Republic, with 33. The second-leading cause for two of the nations was homicide ( 28 in Jamaica , 10 in the Bahamas) and drowning for one (the Dominican Republic with 25). Third was auto vehicle accidents for two (26 in Jamaica and one in the Bahamas) and homicides (20 for the Dominican Republic). And just like with the Dominican Republic, the rate of unnatural death among Americans in both Jamaica and the Bahamas is lower than the odds of getting killed in a homicide in the US.",environmental issues,The New York Times,left
Google Maps Wants to Help You Navigate During Natural Disasters,"When disaster strikes, we've come to rely on our phones. We scroll through Twitter for the latest update on a hurricane or flood, and mark ourselves safe from wildfires or tornadoes on Facebook. Now Google is adding a disaster-navigation tool to Google Maps. Launching later this summer, a new feature on Google Maps will route users away from areas that are affected by extreme weather events. It will allow you to see confirmed road closures in the affected area, as well as suspected closures (based on crowdsourced user responses). Maps users will also be able to share their live location and other details of the event with friends and family members. The idea is to integrate real-time (or near-real-time) information into an app that millions of people already use frequently. ""What we heard from users is they want to be able to see the best and most reliable information in that map context,"" Google Maps product manager Hannah Stulberg told USA Today . There are visual updates to existing alerts coming, too. In the case of a hurricane, a notification card will pop up days in advance with a ""forecast cone"" showing the storm's trajectory and a prediction of when it might hit your area. Likewise, an earthquake ""shake app"" will show the quake's epicenter and magnitude. And in India where the tech giant has been experimenting with AI to predict flooding  Google Maps will display forecasts of when the next flood will come and where the biggest flood risks are. Google's crisis-response efforts aren't new. In 2012, the company launched Public Alerts, which surfaces emergency weather and public-safety alerts near you on Google Maps. And in 2017, it introduced SOS alerts , relevant emergency information that appears at the top of searches and inside Maps. The new features join other private-sector responses to public communication failures during disasters. When Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast in 2012, for example, federal and local government weren't only slow to update the public they couldn't give them clear information on what exactly they were facing. Power outages and lack of cellphone reception caused communication ""black holes."" (Google's latest features do require an internet connection, according to a company representative.) Since then, public agencies have used social media to improve their warning systems and communications, but problems remain, as survivors of last year's deadly wildfires in California recounted to the L.A. Times . One woman said the cellphone warning she received from the state's system advised her to evacuate, but didn't give her essential information about the fire's location. Critics have pointed to a lack of coordination and clear guidelines on how warnings are sent out, as well as ""over-alerting"" when people in non-affected areas also get the warnings. Earlier this year, California Governor Gavin Newsom pledged more than $100 million on top of the $200 million approved in 2018 to fight wildfire. Part of that money will go toward developing better communication strategies and emergency-alert systems, with the goal of bringing ""more consistency"" to the whole process, according to the Associated Press . That kind of investment is needed elsewhere, even as creative startups, tech giants, and collaborative organizations such as Open Street Map come up with their own (often effective) ways of helping people get through disasters which will only become more common as the world gets warmer.",environmental issues,USA Today,center
Teen Argentine tourist falls into a coma during Dominican Republic vacation: report,"A 15-year-old tourist from Argentina is in a coma at a Dominican Republic hospital after suffering organ failure last week, fueling anxiety over the Caribbean country's recent rash of seemingly mysterious deaths. Candela Aylén Saccone suffered a ""diabetic ketoacidosis, with renal failure and cerebral edema"" the same day she was scheduled to return home, according to local and Argentine media. Her family, however, claims she had no history of diabetes. The teen passed out at a Punta Cana hotel on June 19 and was taken to a local hospital before her condition dramatically worsened, Argentina's La Nación newspaper reported. She was then transferred to a Santo Domingo clinic, where she went into a coma, according to La Nación. The clinic said this week that Saccone's condition remains critical but with some improvement. Tourism authorities and the Argentine embassy are monitoring the case. The news comes just days after another US. tourist unexpectedly died while visiting the island nation. Vittorio Caruso, 56, of Glen Cove, N.Y., went into respiratory distress and died last week after drinking something at a Santo Domingo resort. He was at least the 11th American tourist to die in the Dominican Republic since last year. Although the death toll isn't higher than normal , the circumstances over several of them have raised red flags and led the FBI to join some of the investigations. On May 25, Miranda Schaupp-Werner, of Allentown, Pa., died after taking a drink from the minibar from a hotel where she and her husband were staying to celebrate their ninth wedding anniversary. Five days later, Maryland couple Edward Holmes and Cynthia Day were found dead at the same resort complex. In 2018, 13 Americans died in the Dominican Republic from causes including homicide, car accidents and drowning, according to the State Department.     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",health,New York Daily News,left
"Putin, after three days, says fire-hit Russian submarine was nuclear-powered","MOSCOW, July 4 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed on Thursday for the first time that a secret military submarine hit by a fatal fire three days ago was nuclear-powered, prompting Russia's defense minister to assure him its reactor had been safely contained. Russian officials have faced accusations of trying to cover up the full details of the accident that killed 14 sailors as they were carrying out what the defense ministry called a survey of the sea floor near the Arctic. Moscow's slow release of information about the incident has drawn comparisons with the opaque way the Soviet Union handled the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster, and another deadly submarine accident -- the 2000 sinking of the nuclear-powered Kursk, which claimed 118 lives. Russia, which says the details of the submarine involved in the latest accident are classified, said the fire took place on Monday, although it was only officially disclosed late on Tuesday. Until Thursday there was no official word either on whether the vessel had a nuclear reactor, despite intense interest from authorities in neighboring Norway. Putin, in a Kremlin meeting with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, disclosed the fact that the submarine had been nuclear-powered by asking Shoigu about the reactor's condition after the deadly fire. ""The Nuclear reactor on the vessel is completely isolated,"" Shoigu told Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript. ""All the necessary measures were taken by the crew to protect the reactor which is in complete working order,"" he added. The fire erupted in the submarine's battery compartment, Shoigu added, and later spread. Although the Kremlin publicized the Putin-Shoigu meeting on Thursday morning, it was not immediately clear when the two men had met. ""There has not been any formal communication from Russia to us about this,"" Per Strand, a director at the Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority, told Reuters when asked if it had been informed that the submarine was nuclear-powered. ""We understand that they brought the situation under control quickly, under difficult conditions, and there was, as such, no nuclear incident that they were obligated to tell us about,"" he added. ""Still, we would have been happy to have been informed of such incidents."" TOP-SECRET SUBMARINE Shoigu, a close Putin ally, told the Russian leader that the secretive submarine, which authorities said had been operating in the Barents Sea area, could and would be fully repaired. ""In our case, this is not just possible but obligatory,"" Shoigu said of the submarine's repair. ""Right now, we are assessing how long it will take, how much work there is, and how we can carry it out."" A photograph of the deceased sailors circulated on social media on Wednesday. Its authenticity could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters, but it appeared to have been hung on the wall of a Russian military facility. A tribute to the men accompanying the photograph called them heroes and said they had served on board a nuclear-powered deep-sea submersible known by the designation AS-31. Russian media have previously reported, without official confirmation, that the vessel is designed to carry out special operations at depths where regular submarines cannot operate. Made out of a series of inter-connected spheres, which are stronger than the conventional submarine construction and allow it to resist water pressure at great depths, Western military experts have suggested it is capable of probing and possibly even severing undersea communications cables. Shoigu told Putin that the families of the dead sailors would be fully provided for, while the Russian leader, the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, ordered him to draw up proposals to posthumously grant those who were killed state awards. An official investigation into the accident, likely to be shrouded in secrecy, is already underway. The Kommersant daily, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation, has reported that it looks like the deadly fire was started by a powerful electrical short circuit.

jailed daughter of late uzbek leader says gave state $1.2 bn,"The jailed daughter of Uzbekistan's former leader has begged his successor to release her after claiming she gave more than $1.0 billion to the state, while an anti-fraud ruling in her former home of Switzerland deepened her troubles. Gulnara Karimova, the 46-year-old daughter of the late strongman Islam Karimov, was sentenced to a decade behind bars by an Uzbek court in 2017 on fraud and money-laundering charges. In a statement via Instagram on Sunday she stopped short of acknowledging guilt but apologised to the people of the Central Asian nation for ""disappointment that I might have brought"". The former diplomat and popstar said she had given more than $1.2 billion (one billion euros) of her ""personal assets"" to the state ""in the interest of the republic's budget"". The Russian-language story shared on her daughter Iman Karimova's Instagram page also said Karimova and her legal team had relinquished claims to $686 million kept in foreign banks. ""It's authentic,"" Karimova's Swiss lawyer Gregoire Mangeat told AFP of the Instagram post on Monday, while declining to comment on its contents. - First foreign ruling - Karimova's apparent appeal came on the eve of an announcement by the Swiss attorney general on Monday that Switzerland had sent 130 million Swiss francs ($133 million) to Uzbekistan formerly held in bank accounts in the European country. The move follows a first conviction in an anti-corruption investigation in Switzerland in which Karimova is believed to have been a central figure. The Swiss attorney general said the return of funds followed a Swiss court's conviction of an unnamed ""relative of Gulnara Karimova"". The male relative was accused of moving money around bank accounts ""to prevent the origin and actual destination of the funds from being identified,"" the attorney general said in a statement. ""He also signed false bank documents in order to conceal the identity of the true owner of the funds, Gulnara Karimova,"" the statement said. The attorney general's office said the verdict handed to the relative -- a 390,000 franc fine or a 130-day prison sentence --- reflected the fact that he was already serving a heavy sentence in Uzbekistan. Karimova was Uzbekistan's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 2008 to 2017. Her problems in Uzbekistan began in 2014 when her father was still alive and she was reportedly placed under house arrest after hurling insults at her mother and sister on Twitter. In 2018 a court commuted Karimova's sentence to five years under house arrest. But in March this year Uzbek prosecutors said she had been returned to jail for repeatedly violating conditions of her house arrest. In 2017, prosecutors said Karimova was a member of an ""organised criminal group"" that controlled assets worth more than $1.3 billion in 12 countries. Karimova has also been the subject of a multi-year corruption probe targeting Western telecoms firms. US and European investigators say the firms paid her billions of dollars to secure access to the Uzbek market. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took power after the death of Karimov, Uzbekistan's long-reigning hardliner, in 2016. He has won plaudits for reining in many of his predecessor's authoritarian excesses but has kept a repressive political system intact.",politics,Los Angeles Times,left
acting border chief will step down as migrant children are returned to texas facility,"Video by Newsy The Customs and Border Protection agency's acting commissioner, John Sanders, will step down in early July as the government's primary border enforcement executive, a federal official said Tuesday, a development that comes as the agency faces continuing public fury over the treatment of detained migrant children. The news of the resignation came shortly after agency officials disclosed that more than 100 children had been returned to a troubled Border Patrol station in Clint, Tex., a location where a group of lawyers who visited recently said hundreds of minor detainees had been housed for weeks without access to showers, clean clothing, or sufficient food. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter Mr. Sanders announced his resignation in an email to colleagues shortly after it was reported by journalists. He led the agency since President Trump tapped the former Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as homeland security secretary. Mr. Sanders specialized in developing technology for national security initiatives and previously served as the chief technology officer for the Transportation Security Administration. The official who confirmed his resignation, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said it was not clear whether the impending resignation was connected to recent criticism over the agency's management of a large influx of migrant families along the border. In a call with reporters on Tuesday, a Customs and Border Protection official disputed the lawyers' accounts of conditions for hundreds of migrant children at the facility in Clint, saying that detainees who are housed by the agency are given periodic access to showers, and are offered unlimited snacks throughout the day. That assertion ran contrary to what the lawyers, from some of the nation's top law schools, said they were told by children. During a court-ordered visit to the facility earlier this month, some children said they had not been allowed to shower in nearly a month, and were so hungry that it had been hard for them to sleep through the night. [ Read about the conditions migrant children were held in at Clint] ""I personally don't believe these allegations,"" the Customs and Border Protection official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, told reporters. The lawyers' accounts prompted a significant public backlash, after which all but 30 of the roughly 300 children who were being housed in Clint were transferred elsewhere . Some 249 were placed in a shelter network for children run by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, while others were moved to a tent facility in El Paso run by Customs and Border Protection. But on Tuesday, the C.B.P. official said that those moves had alleviated overcrowding in Clint, and allowed for the return of more than 100 children there. The spokesman said that no additional resources had been provided to the children who were sent back. After the lawyers' accounts about Clint were made public, volunteers from around the country began to mobilize, hoping to deliver supplies such as diapers, soap and food to the facility. But those who arrived there were not allowed in and their donations were not accepted, according to local media reports. On the call with reporters on Tuesday, the Customs and Border Protection official said that the agency was reviewing its policy for accepting outside donations, but the official also disputed the idea that supplies were running low. ""We are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward but those items, it's important to note, are available now,"" the official said. Federal officials had previously told the office of Representative Terry Canales, a Democrat from Texas who requested a list of needed supplies, that the agency would not be able to accept outside donations, according to Curtis Smith, Mr. Canalas's chief of staff.",science,AP,center
death of kendall county deputy reminds police officers to use caution during traffic stops,"It's been one week since Deputy Carlos Ramirez with the Kendall County's Sheriff's Office was killed during a traffic stop on I-10. According to the CDC, the main cause of death for police officers is motor vehicle-related incidents, either car crashes or being struck by another driver. ""Another brother killed in the line of duty by something avoidable,"" said Officer Louis Farias. ""It hurts us all, because that could've happened to any of us."" Farias belongs to the Leon Valley Police Department. Assistant Chief Ruben Saucedo said his team makes about 30 to 50 traffic stops a day. ""There are an estimated 80,000 cars that come through the middle of Bandera road on a daily basis,"" Saucedo said. ""And that's just one road."" Saucedo said officers have to keep their head on a swivel, constantly watching the driver and the traffic around them. During a traffic stop demonstration, Farias showed some of the steps they follow to stay safe during a traffic stop. He started by running the license plate to learn basic information about the driver and find out if they have any warrants. He then makes contact with dispatch. ""Dispatch knows I'm on this block number, I'm out on a traffic stop with the license plate I've given,"" he said. As Frias walks up to the driver, he checks the driver's side mirror and back window to find out how many people are in the car. ""I want to hug the vehicle as close as I can to give me the most protection,"" Farias said. ""And I'm making sure they're not reaching for anything that's going to give me any problems."" Whenever Frias walks back to his vehicle, he'll continue to keep an eye on the driver. He said more than 10 years ago, he was taught to walk backward to his patrol car, now it's the opposite. Officers are instructed to walk forward and keep an eye on traffic. ""I'll do a couple looks back to make sure everything is okay,"" Farias said. Saucedo said if you're ever pulled over, you can do your part to keep you and the officer safe. He said you should roll down your windows, then wait to take out your driver's license and insurance information. ""Put your hands on the steering wheel,"" Saucedo said. ""Wait for the officer's instructions. They may just tell you, 'hey you forgot to turn on your tail lights.'"" Even if they follow all the necessary steps, officers can't control the traffic around them. ""It's not safe at all for them to be outside the vehicle,"" Saucedo said. ""Unfortunately, it's the officer that's out 90 percent of the time and they're the ones getting hurt."" So if you see flashing lights, be careful. Our officers want to make it home safe, too.

one dead as dr congo police break up banned marches,"A protester died after being shot at a march in the eastern city of Goma in the DR Congo Sunday as police dispersed hundreds of anti-government protesters in Kinshasa. A day earlier, President Felix Tshisekedi had warned that some protesters did know the difference between democracy and anarchy, but vowed there would be no repression. Police and organisers said the man was shot at a banned march in Goma that had been called to mark the 59th anniversary of the central African country's independence from Belgium. ""One person seriously wounded by gunshot died in hospital,"" national police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu told AFP, while an opposition youth official said: ""They fired real bullets."" Mwanamputu said a policeman was wounded in the Goma unrest adding there was ""resistance"" to police efforts to disperse the marchers. Provincial police commissioner Placide Nyembo told AFP some of the demonstrators were armed. An opposition youth official, Robert Zibawanza, said some activists had torched a commuter minibus. In the capital Kinshasa, on the other side of the country, police used tear gas to break up another banned march. About 50 officers blocked a car carrying former presidential candidate Martin Fayulu and ex-prime minister Adolphe Muzito. An AFP journalist saw police using bayonets to puncture three of the car's tyres. The two men got out of the car to talk to Kinshasa police chief Sylvano Kasongo as demonstrators massed around them. There were scuffles between police and protesters as the officers moved in to broke up the demonstration. Kinshasa police chief Kasongo said one of his officers had been ""seriously wounded"" and that the person responsible had been detained. On Saturday, Tshisekedi said he backed a decision to ban the march planned by his former opposition comrades, pointing to violence that had broken out last weekend. - 'No repression' - Speaking in his first major interview since taking office early this year, Tshisekedi -- son of opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi -- told French media: ""We have the impression that there are some who confuse democracy with anarchy."" He vowed there would be ""no repression"", adding: ""The security forces are trained to keep the peace."" Last Sunday, as opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba flew back into the country, police fired tear gas at rock-throwing protesters who targeted his convoy. Before being elected president, Tshisekedi inherited the mantle of opposition leader from his father Etienne, who died in February 2017. Sunday's march was called by Bemba and Fayulu, who maintains he was robbed of victory in the country's December 30 presidential election. Their Lamuka coalition had vowed to go ahead with the march to protest the constitutional court's invalidation of the election of about 20 opposition lawmakers. Kasongo for his part had warned that any gatherings of more than 10 people would be dispersed. On Sunday, he said there had been ""no major incidents"" in Kinshasa where ""all those arrested were immediately released"" -- apart from the one who attacked the police officer. In the western province of Bandudu, four to six civilians were wounded by live rounds fired by police, several sources said, and a police officer was also reportedly injured. Bandudu is a stronghold of both Fayulu and Muzito. Fayulu, 62, accuses Tshisekedi of being the ""puppet"" of his predecessor Joseph Kabila, whose party enjoys a majority in parliament. A former vice president, Bemba ran unsuccessfully for the presidency against Kabila in 2006. He was then jailed by the International Criminal Court based in The Hague for alleged atrocities carried out by his troops in the Central African Republic. But he was finally acquitted and freed on appeal in June 2018, when he returned to Belgium.",politics,Louisville Courier Journal,left
Mueller agrees to testify before 2 House panels next month,"WASHINGTON   Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, will testify in public before Congress on July 17 about his investigation into Russia's election interference and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, House Democrats announced on Tuesday night. Coming nearly three months after the release of Mueller's report, the back-to-back hearings before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees promise to be must-see television and hold the potential to reshape the political landscape around Trump's presidency and a possible impeachment by the House. Mueller, who has spoken publicly only once about his work, resisted taking the witness stand, where he will face questions both from Democrats eager to employ him to build a case against Trump and Republicans eager to argue for the president's innocence. In the end, the two committees were forced to issue subpoenas compelling Mueller to appear. The chairmen of the panels, Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, wrote in a letter to Mueller on Tuesday that they understood he had reservations about appearing on Capitol Hill, but they were insistent he do so, anyway. ""The American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions,"" the chairmen wrote. ""We will work with you to address legitimate concerns about preserving the integrity of your work, but we expect that you will appear before our committees as scheduled."" The White House declined to comment Tuesday night. Schiff told reporters shortly after the announcement that he expected his committee to meet privately with members of Mueller's staff after his testimony to answer additional questions. As special counsel, Mueller employed a large team of prosecutors and FBI agents whose detailed knowledge of the case could be as valuable to House investigators as Mueller's public statements. It was not immediately clear which committee Mueller would appear before first on July 17, though a copy of the subpoena issued by Nadler indicated that he was to show up before the Judiciary Committee at 9 a.m. The committee leaders have been under intense pressure from Democratic activists and their own rank-and-file members alike to secure an appearance by Mueller. Both Nadler and Schiff initially invited the special counsel to testify voluntarily in April, but discussions proved thorny and protracted. Mueller and his team of prosecutors wanted to avoid a public spectacle, asked to limit his remarks to closed sessions with lawmakers and insisted that their 448-page report would best speak for itself. As of now, it does not appear that Mueller will participate in a hearing before the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers in the majority were less insistent he appear.

Missing hiker found alive after 6 days in woods,"Searchers in rural Arkansas are celebrating Saturday after missing hiker Josh McClatchy was found alive one week after he went missing in the woods of Polk County. McClatchy, 37, was reported missing on June 1 after he went on a hike in the Caney Creek Wilderness area, but ended up getting lost. The Texas native texted his mother to say he needed help, but cellphone service was spotty at best and he was unable to give much help as to his location. Those texts a week ago were the last anyone had heard from McClatchy until Friday night. (MORE: Family desperate to find man lost on Buckeye Trail, Arkansas, for nearly 1 week) After weather and timing issues, search-and-rescue crews finally had a good window for a National Guard helicopter, equipped with infrared technology, to locate McClatchy, according to Polk County Sheriff Scott Sawyer. Sawyer said McClatchy is in good shape and good spirits, but he is dehydrated. He was transported to Mena Regional Health System in Mena, Arkansas, for further evaluation. McClatchy's parents and sister, who regularly posted search updates on a Facebook page, are with him at the hospital. The crew spotted McClatchy from the chopper within 30 minutes of beginning the search, but it took the search team an hour by foot to reach his location about 3 miles into the Caney Creek Wilderness area. He was off the trail when he was located, according to Sawyer. It took about four hours for the rescuers to carry him out on a one-wheeled rescue cart The rescue team consisted of about 35 people in total, Sawyer said.

Alameda County Sheriff's Office Recommending Charges Against Raptors President,"OAKLAND (KPIX)   The Alameda County Sheriff's office is recommending charges for the Toronto Raptors executive who shoved a deputy during Thursday night's Game 6 of the NBA Finals. A longtime Warriors season ticket holder said he saw the entire incident and says he was standing less than a foot from the deputy when it happened. He says it was all a misunderstanding due to the postgame chaos. ""So it was about 30 seconds of action. We left and I didn't think anything else about it except 'oh wow, that was something else,'"" said Greg Wiener, who has been a Warriors season ticket holder for more than 20 years. Wiener says he was there when Raptors president Masai Ujiri got into a scuffle with an Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy while trying to get onto the court for the postgame celebration. ""The policeman steps in front of me, stops Mr. Ujiri by touching him in the chest. Mr. Ujiri steps back, still tried to enter the court, policeman stops him again, then Mr. Ujiri shoved the policeman,"" says Greg. The deputy told investigators he was trying to stop the Raptors president because he did not know who he was and he was not wearing identification. ""I think Mr. Ujiri was excited his team won the championship and just wanted to join those fellows and I think the police man was trying to do his job and not allow unauthorized people onto the court,"" Wiener said. The sheriff's office did not arrest Ujiri immediately after the incident. ""We did show restraint in the fact that he was the president of the Raptors. We did not want to go out onto the court and create any type of spectacle,"" says Sgt. Ray Kelly, the spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriffs Office. Investigators with the sheriffs office said they have video of the entire incident   from both the body camera of the deputy involved and also from security cameras inside Oracle Arena. The deputy went to the hospital suffering from head pain after the incident but Wiener said the deputy was never hit or punched. ""All I saw was Mr. Ujiri shove the policeman right in the chest. That's what I saw,"" said Wiener. The sheriff's office will turn the case over to the district attorney's office next week. According to Sgt. Kelly, they are recommending a charge of misdemeanor battery on an officer. The sheriff's office indicated they cannot release the body camera video right now because it's part of a criminal investigation but might release it in the future. Ujiri was fined twice last year year by the NBA   once for confronting a referee and for cursing during a speech.",legal arguments,KPIX,left
"Florida cracks down on plastic surgery centers, becoming among toughest states","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis late Tuesday signed into law the first major reform in more than a decade to the state's cosmetic surgery industry, giving regulators stronger tools than in many other states. The new law, which takes effect in January, gives the state the power to suspend a clinic's operations or revoke its registration if it determines the facility poses an imminent threat to the public. The legislation was introduced weeks after a USA TODAY Network investigation revealed in February that eight women had died after procedures at a plastic surgery business owned by one doctor. Florida Sen. Anitere Flores, who introduced the legislation, said seeing it signed into law was a ""vindication for those who have been victimized by these bad actors in surgery centers."" ""More than anything, it is something for the victims and their families to look at and… know that this legislation will save future lives,"" said Flores, a Republican. More: This business helped transform Miami into a national plastic surgery destination. Eight women died. For years Florida has lagged behind other states in regulating the cosmetic surgery industry even as it increasingly became a destination for discount procedures, resulting in dozens of injuries and deaths. State lawmakers had tried and failed four times since 2014 to pass legislation that would have cracked down on the surgery centers. Dave Aronberg, the State Attorney for Palm Beach County and a former state senator, said the legislation signed into law Tuesday is ""a step in the right direction to increase regulations to prevent future deaths, but it's disheartening that it's taken this long."" More: Women seeking discount plastic surgery paid with their lives at clinics opened by felons At one point the legislation signed Tuesday also mandated background checks for felons, but that measure was stripped from the bill before its passage. At least 13 women died after surgeries at facilities opened by felons over the past 10 years, the USA TODAY Network reported in April as part of its ongoing investigation. The background checks were pulled off the table after the Agency for Health Care Administration raised concerns about costs, including the possibility of having to pay for seven new staff positions. In cases where a surgery center's registration is revoked, the reform signed into law Tuesday also gives Florida regulators the ability to deny any person named in the office's registration documents from registering a surgery office for five years. The new law is part of broader efforts to tighten regulation of Florida's booming cosmetic surgery industry. The Florida Board of Medicine earlier this month approved an emergency measure prohibiting the injection of fat into the gluteal muscle, a particularly dangerous technique used in a popular surgery known as the Brazilian butt lift.

Brendt Christensen's Ex-Girlfriend Testifies About Wearing A Wire In Yingying Zhang Murder Case,"PEORIA, Ill. (AP)   The former girlfriend of an ex-doctoral student charged with slaying a scholar from China who was visiting the University of Illinois testified Wednesday in federal court that she was scared and conflicted about wearing an FBI wire to record him. Terra Bullis said she truly cared about Brendt Christensen, but also ""cared about this missing person"" Yingying Zhang. ""And it's incredibly painful,"" Bullis said. Christensen, 29, is on trial in federal court in the death of Zhang, who he's accused of luring into his car in 2017 and later killing at his apartment . Prosecutors allege she was raped, choked and stabbed before being pummeled with a baseball bat and decapitated. Her body hasn't been found. Yingying Zhang (FBI) Bullis recorded nine conversations she had with Christensen in person and on the phone for the FBI. During one talk, Christensen told her investigators had found blood in his bedroom and on a baseball bat, and that he led them to believe it was Bullis' blood. ""I made you bleed once on your face,"" Christensen said to Bullis on the recording. ""Do you remember that?"" A prosecutor asked her why she didn't confront her then-boyfriend about what he said. ""I was scared,"" Bullis testified. ""And I wanted to know why he was lying."" Brendt Christensen. (Courtesy: Macon County Sheriff's Office) Bullis said she became ""conflicted"" about her relationship with Christensen in May 2017, when he messaged her about his desire to seek notoriety. She said he was a man she had become attached to emotionally, even though his sentiments weren't representative of someone she would prefer to be attached to. Bullis testified that she and Christensen met on a dating website. She described their first date at a bookstore cafe as ""whimsical."" Christensen was married at the time. Defense attorneys seeking to spare Christensen a death sentence have told jurors he did kill the 26-year-old Zhang . But they dispute some details about how and why he did it. Bullis will resume her testimony Thursday.",crime,AP,center
"Bill Gates: If I were starting a company today, it would use AI to teach computers how to read","Given my background, I would start an AI company whose goal would be to teach computers how to read, so that they can absorb and understand all the written knowledge of the world, Gates told David Rubinstein on Monday. He's also interested in augmented reality, which would have come in handy as he was recently assembling furniture for his daughter. If Bill Gates were to drop out of Harvard University and start a new company today, it would be one that focuses on artificial intelligence, he said in an interview on Monday. The perspective shows that the Microsoft co-founder hasn't lost interest in the technology industry where his company has operated for the past 44 years. ""Given my background, I would start an AI company whose goal would be to teach computers how to read, so that they can absorb and understand all the written knowledge of the world. That's an area where AI has yet to make progress, and it will be quite profound when we achieve that goal,"" Gates told David Rubinstein at an Economic Club of Washington event in the nation's capital on Monday. Gates has invested in Luminous , a start-up developing silicon for AI. Microsoft itself is incorporating AI into its own software while also providing ways for other companies to draw on AI in their products. Another area Microsoft has been working to commercialize is augmented reality, including with its HoloLens headset . Gates, who now spends about one-sixth of his time at Microsoft, mentioned this type of technology in Monday's conversation. Rubinstein said Bill's wife Melinda Gates had told him that at one point Gates had to go to a store to buy furniture for his daughter's new room at Stanford University. ""It was actually kind of hard to assemble some of that stuff,"" Gates said in response. ""I wanted augmented reality to help show me how to put the pieces together properly."" Beyond technology, Gates said he's fascinated by developments in biology and energy. He said he enjoys the time he spends at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the 1,500-person nonprofit where he is a co-chair and trustee. He finds the problem of climate change ""super interesting,"" he said, and said he gets to meet with scientists and go out into the field. ""I love my work,"" he said. He said that if people have ideas that could make a difference in public health or could improve K-12 education, we're ""super-interested.""

conservative party members would rather break up the united kingdom than stop brexit,"Conservative members would rather break up the United Kingdom and destroy their own party than see Brexit stopped. A new YouGov poll finds hardline views on Europe and the UKs future among those soon to choose the next prime minister. A clear majority would rather Scotland and Northern Ireland left the UK and would be willing to accept significant damage to the economy, if it allowed Brexit to go ahead. The findings come ahead of the next round of voting in the Conservative party leadership contest. Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories. LONDON - Conservative members would rather break up the United Kingdom, and destroy their own party, than stay in the European Union, according to a new poll. The latest YouGov poll of Conservative party members, who will soon be charged with choosing the UK's next prime minister, suggests they would opt to see both Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the UK, if it was the only way to ensure the UK leaves the EU. Sixty three per cent say they would rather Scotland left the UK if it secured Brexit, with 61% willing to accept ""significant damage"" to the economy and 59% willing to see Northern Ireland leave the UK. A further 54% would want Brexit to go ahead even if it meant the destruction of their own party. So committed to Brexit are members of the Conservative and Unionist Party that they would be willing to see Scotland (63%) and Northern Ireland (59%) leave the UK in order to secure it. https://t.co/9iJKlB292v pic.twitter.com/4j7bCPg6aK   YouGov (@YouGov) June 18, 2019 The poll suggests that Brexit has hardened the divide over Europe in the party. It found that 46% of members would now be ""happy"" to have Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage as their leader, with just 40% unhappy. Overall, Conservative party members now see the Brexit Party as their biggest threat, with 67% describing it as a ""big threat"" compared to just 34% saying the same of Labour. Brexit has also reshaped the two-party system in the eyes of Tory members. Fully two thirds (67%) see the Brexit Party as a big threat to them, almost double the number who say the same of Labour (34%) https://t.co/9iJKlB292v pic.twitter.com/eIv9o1aelF   YouGov (@YouGov) June 18, 2019 Views on Europe appear to have hardened significantly in the race to succeed Theresa May as prime minister, with a majority now saying it would be unacceptable for their next leader to be opposed to leaving the EU without a deal.

"Flynn's new lawyer is a Mueller critic, praised by Trump","WASHINGTON   Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has hired a new lawyer, a former federal prosecutor who has earned the praise of President Donald Trump and repeatedly denigrated the Russia investigation. Trump took notice of Flynn's new legal representation, calling Sidney Powell a ""GREAT LAWYER"" and wishing luck to them both on Twitter. Powell responded, ""Thank you Mr. President!!"" and ""I'm honored."" The change in lawyers, especially to one with a publicly combative stance toward special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, may herald a shift in Flynn's legal strategy in the final stages of his case. And Trump's words of support for Flynn and his new attorney reflect the president's continued interest in, and occasional sympathy for, some of his former aides entangled in the investigation. Flynn became a key cooperator for Mueller after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations during the presidential transition period with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He was supposed to have been sentenced in December, but the hearing was abruptly cut short after Flynn asked to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating with the Justice Department and earn additional credit toward a reduced sentence. Powell has been an outspoken critic of Mueller's investigation. On Twitter, she advertises a T-shirt with cartoonish images of Mueller and his team bearing the slogan ""Creeps on a Mission."" She is also the author of a book titled ""Licensed to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice."" She confirmed in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday that she was Flynn's new lawyer. Asked about a subpoena for his records and testimony announced Thursday by the House intelligence committee, Powell said, ""The General is continuing to cooperate with the government"" but otherwise declined to comment. Mueller's investigation ended in March with a report that found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to tip the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor. But it did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had obstructed justice. It is not clear how much additional legal work is required for Flynn as he awaits sentencing. In a recent court filing, Flynn's former lawyers, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, revealed that they had been fired but they did not say why. At Flynn's December hearing, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan declared himself disgusted by Flynn and raised the question of whether his actions amounted to treason. He later backpedaled and said he didn't mean to suggest that they did. Powell told AP in February that she was sitting with members of the Flynn family on the day of that hearing. ""I was absolutely stunned,"" Powell told AP. ""The first thing that stunned me was that the judge had the facts all wrong. Here we are in a high-profile case like this involving false statements, and Judge Sullivan comes out with false information and a complete misunderstanding of the facts of the case, and he had the chance to prepare for it. I was flabbergasted."" Trump has long taken a keen interest in Flynn's case, wishing him luck on the morning of his sentencing last December. Trump's former attorney John Dowd left Kelner a phone message last year in which he asked for a heads-up if Flynn had incriminating information about Trump that he planned to share with prosecutors. ___ Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island.",legal arguments,The Associated Press,center

"PG&E found problems with lines after cutting power to 22,000 during hot June windstorm","The hot, dry winds that forced PG&E to cut power earlier this month to about 22,000 customers in high-risk fire areas damaged a handful of electric lines in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the utility reported. The state-required report, which was released Friday, provides details of the utility's preemptive power shutdowns on June 8 and 9, which came in the wake of last fall's devastating Northern California wildfires sparked by the company's transmission lines. ""PG&E knows how much our customers rely on electric service, and the impacts these events can have on them, their families, businesses and communities,"" the report said. ""PG&E considers temporarily turning off power, based on weather and fire-risk conditions, only in the interest of safety to reduce the risk of wildfire."" On June 7, a red flag weather alert, with a forecast of hot, dry weather and powerful winds, persuaded the utility to warn customers around Lake Berryessa and in the Butte County region torched by the last year's devastating Camp Fire that their power could be shut off. The Lake Berryessa shutdowns took place around 6 a.m. on June 8, with the Butte County power lines de-energized later that evening. Power was restored to all customers by 6 p.m. on June 9, the company said. When utility crews went out to inspect the power lines before turning the electricity back on, they found potential problems. While no damage was found in the North Bay locations, ""PG&E discovered five instances of wind-related issues ... that required remediation"" in the Sierra foothill area, the report stated. In two cases, there was damage to service drops, which are lines from a power pole into a business or residence. Both of them appeared to be caused by falling vegetation, including a tree in Oroville (Butte County) that slammed into a shed and cable wire, as well as the power line, the PG&E report stated. The lines had to be repaired before power was restored. In three other cases in Chico, falling branches landed on PG&E conductors and had to be cleared by the crews. Those are the type of incidents that safety officials have warned could   and have   sparked fires if the lines were left powered. The report said the utility had identified some problems with the service shut-off, which was the first of what could be many during this year's fire season. They included not giving the impacted cities 24 hours notice before cutting the power, and delays in providing detailed maps of the areas affected, as well as the need for improved communications with public safety agencies, including local law enforcement and state and local fire officials. So far, no complaints about the shut-off have been filed with the state Public Utilities Commission. The only claim filed with the utility was one for spoiled food, the report stated.

Earthquake researchers look for lessons in Trona damage,"As the trio of researchers eyed the aging buildings in Trona, it was hard for them to tell which were severely damaged by the earthquakes that pummeled this San Bernardino County town in recent days   and which were simply old and abandoned. ""Some of this damage was already here,"" said Kenneth O'Dell, 55, a structural engineer. But he nonetheless noted that the earthquake had hit Trona hard, particularly because the walls of most buildings were not reinforced with steel or other material that can keep them upright, or prevent cracking during severe tremors. ""It looks like most of these structures were built during the 1930s and 1940s,"" O'Dell said. ""So it makes sense that they weren't ready for this kind of shaking."" O'Dell had arrived from Los Angeles on Saturday with engineer Martin Hudson and his 25-year-old son, geologist Kenneth Hudson, to assess earthquake damage in Trona and nearby Ridgecrest after massive quakes rocked the region. Their goal was to study the structural damage of the buildings in Trona so they could understand how exactly the earthquakes affected those structures and surrounding areas. These findings, they hoped, could someday be published in a research paper and help guide future geologists and engineers. They stopped Saturday afternoon on California 178 between Trona and Ridgecrest, where the elder Hudson stood on one of the fault ruptures caused by Friday's magnitude 7.1 quake. ""It's moved everything three feet to the right,"" said Hudson, 52, an engineer who forms part of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, an organization based in Oakland that brought researchers together in the Ridgecrest area to study the effects of the earthquakes. After assessing the fault rupture, the three researchers hopped in their car and headed to Trona, about thirty miles northeast of Ridgecrest. At the side of a faded pink house at the community's entrance, the researchers noted that soil liquefaction had caused portions of the ground to crack and collapse   some of the soil had started turning into a liquid state, the researchers explained. Nearby, a chimney had caved in on one of the houses. ""We saw a lot of this type of damage in the '94 Northridge earthquake,"" O'Dell said. In the end, the three anticipate that their research could help prevent future building damage during earthquakes. ""The goal of our research is to improve the designs of these structures so that they are not as susceptible, and we're hoping that our work today can contribute to that,"" Kenneth Hudson said. giulia.mcdonnell@latimes.com Twitter: @GiuliaMcDonnell",science,Los Angeles Times,left

I've been testing both for the past several weeks and they don't seem too buggy, but you should always expect a few bugs since this isn't the final version of the software. Because of that, you may not want to install the iOS 13 beta on your primary phone, since it takes some effort to go back to the old software and some things might not work as expected. Before you start, be sure to back up your iPhone and iPad. How to back up your iPhone and iPad Open Settings Tap your name at the top of the screen. Select iCloud. Scroll to iCloud backup and make sure it's on. Tap ""Back up now."" How to install the iOS 13 public preview iOS 13 includes lots of new features, including dark mode , which adds a dark hue to most of Apple's apps (other apps can build in support too), which both looks cool and is easier on your eyes at night. One of my favorite features is the new Photos app, which shows highlights of pictures you took each day, month or year, with live pictures and videos coming to life right in your camera roll. It also includes new Animoji, support for custom emoji that can be designed to look like you, a new portrait camera mode and a lot more. Here's how to install it: Go to Apple's beta software page and sign up for the program, or sign in if you tested the public preview of iOS 12 last year. Enroll your iPhone by downloading the iOS 13 public preview profile. You do this by visiting Apple's beta page from your iPhone. Approve the installation of the beta profile. Restart your iPhone. Connect to a Wi-Fi network if you aren't already connected to one. Go to Settings > General > Software update. Your iPhone will discover the iOS 13 public preview as an update and will begin downloading. Install it. Your iPhone will restart. How to install the iPadOS public preview Apple is no longer using the same software for iPads and iPhones. The iPad now has its own operating system called iPadOS. It adds a ton of new features, including the ability to multitask more efficiently by swapping between open apps and the option to run two windows of the same app side by side. It also brings the ""Today"" widget panel right to the home screen, so you can see the weather, your calendar events and much more all without swiping. Like iOS 13, it also includes a new dark mode option, new photos, new maps and more. Here's how to install it: Go to Apple's beta software page and sign up for the iPadOS public preview. Enroll your iPad by downloading the iOS 13 public preview profile. You do this by visiting Apple's beta page from your iPad. Your iPad will ask you to approve the installation of the beta profile. Restart your iPad. Connect to a Wi-Fi network. Go to Settings > General > Software update. Your iPad will see the iPadOS public preview and will download it for you. Install it.

retirements will bring changes to milwaukee county circuit court,"A couple of veteran Milwaukee County judges have decided to retire, opening up what have been, over the past eight years, rare appointment opportunities for Democratic-leaning would-be replacements. Kitty Brennan, currently a member of the District I Court of Appeals, said her 25 years on that court, the circuit court and as chief judge has been long enough. ""I have been very lucky,"" she said. ""They're three different jobs but all were fun, intellectual puzzles and people-intense. I loved that."" Brennan, 69, was speaking by phone from Vermont, where she was visiting a daughter, something she plans to do more of when she's finally done in September, and no plans to become a reserve judge or mediator. ""I've been working as an adult 44 years, and had four kids in six years of that time,"" she said. ""I want to goof off with my family and friends. I'm looking forward to it."" Brennan said that over the 25 years, the volume of cases in Milwaukee County was always a challenge and will likely remain a big challenge, presenting the chance for big rewards. ""The best part of the job is my fellow judges. They're your work family, like most jobs. Everyone is trying to do the best thing, without all the needed resources."" Circuit Judge Michael Dwyer, also 69, said he was retiring to keep doing what he was already doing, not because he was just named ""Judge of the Year"" by the state bar's Bench and Bar Committee, ""though going out on top doesn't hurt,"" he joked. ""I was leaving family division, where I've spent most of my time and done most of any good I've done,"" he said, referring to the recent judicial rotation order from Chief Judge Maxine White that would have moved him to Children's Court. ""I wasn't going to stay too much longer anyway, so I decided I can stay in the field by retiring,"" to work as a mediator in divorce and other family law matters. Dwyer said he has the distinction, among long-tenured Milwaukee County judges, of never having presided over an adult, criminal court calendar. ""It was because I liked best what most judges like least -- children and family court."" Of his 22 years on the bench, Dwyer spent 12 in family court. He will leave the job in late September. He said his proudest achievement was his role in getting professional rules amended to allow lawyers who act as mediators to draft legal documents for the parties, who more and more often, don't have lawyers. ""The rule enables change, but now lawyers have to change how they approach their roles in that context. I hope I can practice what I've preached."" Gov. Tony Evers' office sought applicants for appointment to fill both Brennan's and Dwyer's seats and is expected to announce selections soon. Evers announced his first judicial appointment last week. He named Quarles & Brady associate Rachel Graham to a seat on the District IV Court of Appeals in Madison, to replace retiring Judge Gary Sherman. Meanwhile, one of former Gov. Scott Walker's last appointments faces a challenger who's already lining up some big endorsements. Daniel Gabler had been serving as chairman of the Wisconsin Parole Commission since 2017 when he was appointed to replace Richard Sankovitz who resigned to join a mediation firm. Almost immediately, Rebecca Kiefer, an assistant district attorney since 2004, announced she would be running for the seat, which is up for election in spring 2020. Last week, she won the endorsement of her boss, District Attorney John Chisholm, adding his name to several current and retired judges. Gabler has also begun listing endorsers, including judges, on his campaign web site. Contact Bruce Vielmetti at (414) 224-2187 or bvielmetti@jrn.com. Follow him on Twitter at @ProofHearsay.

shark bites child in third north carolina attack this season,"BALD HEAD ISLAND, N.C. (AP)   A shark bit an 8-year-old boy in the third shark attack this season along the North Carolina coast, according to state officials. News outlets report the boy was swimming in open water at Bald Head Island on Sunday afternoon when a shark grabbed him by the leg, causing multiple bite wounds. WECT reports the child, who wasn't immediately identified, was transported on a ferry to the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. The boy is the third person to be attacked by a shark in the state this month. Last week, a 19-year-old was bitten by a shark in Ocean Isle, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) down the same coastline from where a 17-year-old girl lost most of her leg to a shark attack at Fort Macon State Park earlier this month. Last year, North Carolina saw three unprovoked shark attacks total, down from six attacks in 2015. Between 2009 and 2018, North Carolina typically experienced one to three unprovoked shark bites each year, making it one of the top six states for unprovoked shark attacks in the United States. ""We don't usually have three by June,"" said Gavin Naylor, program director for the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida in Gainesville, a research organization that tracks shark bite reports worldwide. ""But you could get none in June next year; you need to look at the overall trends."" North Carolina is more popular for shark bites because it also attracts more tourists due to its beautiful beaches, Naylor said, which means more people doing water sports or activities that can cause a shark to mistake them for food. Most of the shark bites are typically from blacktip sharks, according to Naylor, which migrate in large numbers from Florida up to the Carolinas every May. ""They basically park themselves and breed in the Carolinas from June to August,"" he said. But in recent years, researchers have been seeing fewer and fewer blacktip sharks, along with lessening numbers of the fish they feed on. Typically, Naylor said he sees about 15,000 blacktip sharks in Florida every winter, but last year, only saw about 6,000 and attributes this to changing ocean temperatures that may make the fish, and the blacktip sharks, disperse more. Overall, the number of shark attacks in the United States has been increasing every year, he said, as the beaches get more and more populated and most of these attacks occur in Florida. In general, Naylor said shark attacks are still very rare and the risk of being attacked is extremely lower than the risk of drowning. To reduce risk, he advised people to heed public safety warnings, avoid bringing shiny objects like jewelry into the water, and be wary of areas where freshwater meets the sea, since that is where more bull sharks are found. It's believed that the 17-year-old girl who had her leg amputated after a shark attack at Fort Macon State Park earlier this month was attacked by a bull shark, which tend to be more larger, more aggressive sharks and are one of the most likely to go after humans.",science,Bloomberg News,center
"man arrested for running over pregnant woman, 2-year-old son, police say","Police in Jefferson City, Tennessee, have arrested a man they said intentionally ran over a pregnant woman and her 2-year-old son. Sierra Wilson-Cahoon, who is originally from Parkton, and her unborn child and son were all killed. The entire community in northern Baltimore County is in mourning, trying to comprehend what happened. Friends and family said Wilson-Cahoon's smile could light up a room. Now a man is behind bars and accused of the deaths of Wilson-Cahoon, her unborn child and her son, saying, ""The government told me to do it."" ""You can't believe anybody on this world is mean enough that they could do this on purpose,"" Melba Wilson, Wilson-Cahoon's grandmother, said. From her Parkton farm, where 30-year-old Wilson-Cahoon spent much of her life, Wilson tries to make sense of a terrible tragedy. ""If you really go to church like we do and believe in God, how could somebody be this evil and do this to somebody? You can't understand it,"" Wilson said. Police in Jefferson City said that Monday afternoon, 33-year-old William David Phillips ran over Wilson-Cahoon who was pregnant and her 2-year-old son Nolan while they were walking. ""He was so advanced and so many things at age 2. I couldn't imagine how smart he was at that age. He was just such a remarkable person, Wilson said. According to an arrest warrant, Phillips told police a voice told him to ""kill all the meth addicts"" and he started driving very fast. Witnesses said it was terrifying. ""Stroller and the baby was laying with her. They were laying on top of her. The baby in the stroller must've never left her you know?"" witness Billy Ray Jones said. Wilson-Cahoon graduated from Hereford High School in 2006 and High Point University in 2012. She and her husband moved to Tennessee, where he works as an assistant athletic director at Carson-Newman University. ""The Carson-Newman family mourns today over this tragic loss. Our hearts are breaking for one of our own. We take comfort in knowing that God also feels our pain and hears our prayers. Because of this, we ask for prayers for Matt and his family now and in the days ahead."" Paul Percy, Carson-Newman University interim president said. Wilson-Cahoon's mother sent 11 News a statement that read, in part, ""We (her family) are crushed and are trying to figure out how to go on without Sierra, Nolan and the baby she was carrying."" ""They were a wonderful family just wonderful to everybody. (I) will never understand how it could've ever, ever happened,"" Wilson said. The family has started a GoFundMe page, and anyone can donate here . Wilson-Cahoon's mother told 11 News over the phone they will be having funeral services in Tennessee Thursday and Friday, then there will be a burial in Maryland next week. Services have been scheduled for Friday at First Baptist Church on the campus of Carson-Newman University in Jefferson City, Tennessee, from 5 to 7 p.m. On Wednesday, there will be visitation from 10 to 11 a.m. with a service following at Grace Fellowship in Shrewsbury (74 E.

"24,000 pounds of garbage were just removed from Mount Everest, leading to the discovery of four dead bodies","The Nepalese government has removed just over 24,000 pounds of trash from Mount Everest, according to the Associated Press . During their cleanup of the world's highest mountain , cleaners also uncovered four dead bodies. Among the 11 tons of recovered trash from the 45-day project are food wrappers, cans, bottles and empty oxygen cylinders, Tourism Department official Danduraj Ghimire said. Cleaning up the mountain has been extremely difficult due to unpredictable weather conditions, inaccessibility of certain areas and the inherent dangers involved. Ghimire said the four dead bodies were found by the cleaners in melting snow and were taken to base camp before being flown to a hospital in the capital for identification, AP reports. None of the bodies have been identified and it is not known when they died. Some of the waste was flown to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, in army helicopters. Officials presented it to recyclers in a ceremony to officially conclude to clean up project, the AP reports. ""Unfortunately, some garbage collected in bags at the South Col could not be brought down due to bad weather,"" Ghimire said in a statement on Wednesday . According to AP, officials said the mission has been ""successful,"" but that some of the trash still covered by snow will need to be collected once temperatures rise. Additionally, 300 climbers have died on Everest since 1953, but officials are unsure of how many bodies are still on the mountain While the exact amount of garbage on the mountain is unknown, climbers report that human excrement, used oxygen bottles, torn tents, ropes, broken ladders, cans and plastic wrappers litter the slopes from decades of climbing, according to Reuters. This could potentially be the busiest climbing season on record   increasing the risk of death and the amount of trash left behind. With at least 11 people losing their lives, this has been the deadliest climbing season on Mount Everest since 2015. Nepal issued 381 permits   the highest number ever   which has contributed to the chaos on the mountain and the excessive amount of trash.",environmental issues,Associated Press,center

"empty and abandoned, haunting pictures show the remains of wooden home on georgia plantation that horrified actress fanny kemble so much it inspired her to publish her famous anti-slavery journal","These images reveal the abandoned remains of one of the largest plantations in the the south which horrified actress Fanny Kemble so much, she published her now famous anti-slavery journal. These images reveal the abandoned remains of one of the largest plantations in the South, which horrified actress Fanny Kemble so much that it led to her publishing her now famous anti-slavery journal. Scroll through for more pictures of Butler Island Plantation and the home that still stands there... As well as Butler Plantation, the property holds Huston House which was home to the former owner of the New York Yankees, TL Huston. A sign still adorns a wooded pathway leading to the house saying: 'COL T.L HUSTON'S HOME'. He bought the plantation and built the house in 1926   13 years after he bought the Yankees. The haunting pictures show the exterior of the white-paneled house on the extensive grounds, located just south of Darien, Georgia, as well as the surprisingly well-maintained interior. The images were captured by an urban explorer known as Abandoned Southeast. Frances Anne 'Fanny' Kemble (1809-1893) visited the house in 1838 with her husband Pierce Butler and was so appalled by the slavery that she went on to write an anti-slavery journal that helped inspire the abolitionist movement. The reception area or dining room inside the vast property. The photographer said of the project: 'The story of the plantation is a fascinating one, beginning in the 1790s, when Major Pierce Butler - one of the Founding Fathers of the United States - planted the land on the Altamaha Delta, which provided the perfect conditions for growing rice.' When the major's grandson, Captain Pierce Butler, married famous and beautiful British stage actress Fanny Kemble, he tried to keep her from the plantation, as she was not familiar with the reality of slavery, and immediately became very opposed to their treatment. At Kemble's insistence, the family finally spent the winter of 1838-39 there and the actress kept a diary of her observations, flavored strongly by the abolitionist sentiment. She eventually published a book called 'Journal of a Resident on a Georgia Plantation', which some say helped persuade the British to oppose slavery and the Civil War. Her memoir circulated in American abolitionist circles, but she waited until 1863, during the American Civil War, to publish her work. This picture shows the damaged porch that overlooks the grounds where hundreds of slaves lived and worked in deplorable conditions. This picture shows the surprisingly well-maintained entrance hall of Huston House, with natural light and few signs of decay. There are currently no long-term plans for use or maintenance of the home. The Plantation is currently owned by the Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division. A bathroom typical of the era complete with turquoise tiles, thick radiators, a clunky period sink and antique light fittings. Despite being exposed to the elements, the interior has largely stood the test of time. When TL Huston bought the land in 1926, he converted the former rice plantation into a dairy farm and attempted to raise cows. Locals proclaimed Huston's Dairy the best milk east of the Mississippi. Huston built this cow shed on the property but, according to the photographer, the dairy farm proved to be difficult: 'He hauled off the cows in 1932 and found success using the plantation to grow iceberg lettuce. Butler Island became one of the largest iceberg lettuce farms on the east coast within a decade.' After Huston's death in 1938, Butler Island Plantation was purchased by tobacco heir R.J. Reynolds, Jr. All operations on the grounds ceased by the 1970s. Today, the grounds are open to the public for picnicking, fishing and bird watching. The house is currently vacant and not open to the public. In 1913, Colonel T.L. Huston, pictured right, partnered with fellow Colonel, Jacob Ruppert Jr., and purchased the American League Baseball Club of New York, later known as the New York Yankees.

Pennsylvania Department Of Health Appoints Temporary Manager For Hahnemann University Hospital,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS)   The Pennsylvania Department of Health is getting involved with the closure of Hahnemann University Hospital.

""She's coherent and making sure nothing is broken or anything like that."" EMS responded within minutes, but with the emergency department closed at Hahnemann, they were forced to take her elsewhere. Yates remained on scene.

Hundreds Gather in Morgan Hill at Vigil Honoring Ford Dealership Shooting Victims,"MORGAN HILL (KPIX)   Two days after the fatal Ford store shooting in Morgan Hill, hundreds gathered Thursday night to remember the two victims. ""We're praying for them, for God's peace to be with them,"" said Chantel Warren who lives near the dealership. On Tuesday at 6:03 p.m., Steven Leet shot and killed his supervisor Xavier Souto. Souto had fired him two hours prior but Morgan Hill police said Leet continued to linger at his work station before he ended up in a back office with Souto and Souto's supervisor, Bright Light. Investigators said Leet shot Souto at close range in the head, then turned the gun on Light when he tried to disarm Leet. In a news conference Wednesday, police said Light's actions were heroic as it gave customers and employees the seconds they needed to run out of the Ford store to safety. Leet then walked out of the business to a parking lot and sat on a curb. As the first officers arrived on scene they heard a single gunshot. Leet had taken his own life. On Thursday, the victims' families and friends attended the candlelight vigil but did not want to speak publicly. They were surrounded by community members, law enforcement and city leaders who joined in their moment of grief at the Morgan Hill Amphitheatre. ""The husband goes off to work, says, 'I'll see you tonight' and then something like this happens,"" said Kathy Delacruz. ""You just never know what's going to happen."" Delacruz attended the vigil to support the victims' families, she said but she also attended because the tragic event will impact her own family forever. Her grandson, she said, works at the Ford store, knew the victims and the shooter and was at work on Tuesday. ""He heard the gunshots and the employees all ran next door to the hotel,"" she said. Jacob Owens, a Ford store employee, said the shooting was unexpected. He attended the vigil and said he appreciated the support from the community. ""It's nice that it's not just coworkers or people who knew them, it's nice that it's a lot of the community,"" Owens said. Clyde Pineda knew Souto for several years. Their sons went to the same martial arts studio. ""I was hoping it wasn't him,"" Pineda said. ""Unfortunately, we found out his name came up it was like, 'wow'"" He said he came out to the vigil to support Souto's family and to remember two men who died suddenly and tragically. ""Definitely a gentle giant, just a family man,"" he said ""It's just definitely not, definitely not real."" The Ford store opened Thursday for the first time since the shooting but some employees chose to stay home. Grief counselors were on hand.",crime,KPIX,left
Verizon now sells a $100 tracking device with one year of free service,"Verizon today launched sales of the $99.99 Verizon Smart Locator , a tiny device that can be kept with your keys, bag, or other possessions (or pets) that you never want to lose. Similar to the Samsung SmartThings Tracker that AT&T sells , Verizon's new gadget uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi-based positioning (WPS), and LTE coverage ""for pinpoint accuracy wherever your mobile network is present."" Unlike a Tile, which requires you to be in Bluetooth range to find a missing item it's attached to, Verizon says the Smart Locator will work even if you're nowhere near it. (Tile also has a community-based feature that alerts you if another Tile owner should pass by your lost property.) A companion Smart Locator Hub app for smartphones allows you to adjust the frequency of location pings   doing less of them will help preserve battery   and set up other options like geofencing (for a dog in your backyard, perhaps) or add up to 10 trusted contacts who will also be able to check where the Locator is if there's a situation where you're unable to. The Smart Locator isn't a full-on LTE device like your smartphone or smartwatch. Instead, it uses LTE-M technology and requires less bandwidth on Verizon's network. The carrier says it will maintain signal and be able to report its location in all areas with Verizon LTE coverage   but you'll be out of luck if the Locator winds up in roaming territory, and it'll do you no good internationally. (Presumably the Bluetooth functionality still works in these cases, at least.) The Tile Pro tracker, by contrast, has a range limit of 300 feet. But it's also a fraction of the cost at $30 and doesn't require a recurring service plan. Verizon will give you a free year of tracking with the Smart Locator, but after that you'll have to pay $3 per month. (AT&T charges $5 monthly for its SmartThings Tracker, but it, too, gives buyers a free year.)

Weather Officials Confirm Tornado Touches Down In Mount Laurel,"MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (CBS)   For the fourth time this year, a tornado has touched down in New Jersey, doubling the state's yearly average. The National Weather Service confirmed EF-0 tornado swept through Mount Laurel on Saturday, reaching speeds up to 70 mph. Dramatic surveillance video shows high winds lifting an employee's car and throwing it in front of glass wall of a company called Castle Windows in a business park in Mount Laurel, near I-295. Thirty employees were inside the building when the tornado passed through. No one was injured. ""I was walking out of Produce Junction on Route 73 in Made Shade and there was just a big funnel cloud spinning, turned in to be three of them and dropped out to be one,"" Jonathan Mazanec, of Pennsauken, said. ""It looked like it flipped a car behind me."" Mount Laurel firefighters, along with police, arrived on scene. The fire department shared video of the tornado touching down on its Facebook page. Crews from the National Weather Service arrived from the Mount Holly, New Jersey office to survey the damage. ""It's nice to be here in person to interact with the people who saw the tornado, people who were in the building at the time,"" Alex Starman, of the National Weather Service, said, ""and also to talk with the emergency managers and first responders because they help us out."" They say the flipped car isn't the only damage. ""I saw some roof damage as well, inside there was some damage to the roof tiles,"" Trent Davis, of the National Weather Service, said. As for Mazanec, capturing the video is a moment that he will never forget. ""It was pretty scary,"" he said. The National Weather Service says the tornado was on the ground for 0.07 miles.

"from big oranges to bears, readers recall roadside gems","A recent Flashback about examples of Central Florida's past and present programmatic or novelty architecture inspired readers to share some great memories. This phenomenon has also been called mimetic architecture   a building's design mimicked its function or a product associated with the building. For example, a hot-dog stand might look like a giant hot dog. We've had some great examples in Florida; thanks to the readers who shared their roadside favorites. Here's a sample. Twinkling sprinkles ""The recent ""Flashback"" on mimetic architecture made me think of the ever-more numerous Twistee Treat ice cream stands around Orlando. We love the newer ones with tiny lights on top that look like sprinkles.""   John and Chris Robinson, Poinciana Big citrus on Lee Road ""Reading about fun Florida architecture reminded me of the large oranges and grapefruit that for many years were beside Lee Road, on the northwest corner of what is now Interstate 4. (I don't recall whether or not they were there before the interstate.) ""When I was a kid, whenever we drove past these huge citrus fruits, I knew we were going out of town   or at least to Forest City. I have heard that pilots looked for them because they were easy to spot from the air; they let the pilots know exactly where they were. I never measured them or stood beside them, but I think they must have been 10 feet tall.

Born in 1915, Baer grew up in Ohio and first arrived in Orlando in 1944 as part of the Civilian Public Service program, his 2002 obituary noted (Baer died in Tallahassee at age 86). In 1945, Baer purchased half interest in a radio store and over the years built a business with four stores in Orlando, Winter Park, and Altamonte Springs, as well as departments in stores that his business leased in Sarasota, Bradenton, Tampa, Fort Myers and St. Petersburg. His trademark bears included a giant sign that once stood on the roof of the Mills Avenue building and several seriously large examples of taxidermy that were once on display in his stores.

'Uber Eats with Guns': Mike Pompeo allegedly had his taxpayer-funded security detail pick up his Chinese food and walk his dog,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is allegedly using taxpayer-funded security detail to pick up his Chinese food, walk his dog, and bring his adult son from Union Station in Washington, D.C. to the family's home, according to a State Department whistleblower. Congressional investigators told CNN that Democrats ""on a key House congressional committee,"" are now investigating the claims against Pompeo. Another issue raised by the whistleblower relates to Pompeo's wife, Susan, Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is under investigation by House Democrats following allegations that he used his taxpayer-funded security detail to pick up his takeout and walk his dog. According to CNN , Democrats ""on a key House congressional committee,"" are investigating the claims, which were disclosed by a State Department whistleblower over a period of several months. Pompeo isn't the first White House official to face scrutiny over taxpayer spending: former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spent nearly $139,000 to renovate three sets of office doors allegedly in need of repair; Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson doled out $31,000 for a mahogany dining set; and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price spent more than $1 million on travel (including $400,000 for private jets). Read more: $1 million in private flights and a $31,000 table -here are the 6 Trump Cabinet members under scrutiny for their lavish spending of taxpayer money While Pompeo - thankfully - didn't buy thousands of dollars worth of furniture with taxpayer dollars, he did allegedly instruct special agents to complete some questionable tasks while on the clock. For instance, CNN noted that the Secretary of State instructed a special agent to pick up Chinese food (without Pompeo in the car), retrieve his dog from the groomer, and pick up his adult son from Union Station in Washington, D.C. and bring him to the family's home. Agents complained that they felt like ""UberEats with guns,"" multiple Democratic congressional aides told CNN, citing the whistleblower. ""Sending subordinates to run personal errands for you is the very definition of misuse of position,"" former government ethics czar Walter Shaub told CNN. While Lon Fairchild, the special agent in Charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, didn't dispute the allegations, he said in a statement ""I was head of Secretary Pompeo's security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24-hours a day, 7-days a week."" Another issue raised by the whistleblower relates to Pompeo's wife, Susan, who was assigned her own detail in 2018, despite being at home in the United States. A former senior Diplomatic Security official told CNN that a full-time detail for a spouse is unusual. There are also questions surrounding why Susan Pompeo has the privileges of a State Department staffer.

"darwin hindman, longest-serving columbia mayor, dead at 86","Darwin Hindman, Columbia's longest-serving mayor and a recreation advocate honored for his work to create the Katy Trail State Park, died Sunday evening. He was 86. Axie Hindman, his wife of almost 59 years, said Monday that he succumbed after a long battle with pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive, incurable disease. ""We are thankful for the wonderful life he had,"" Hindman said. ""We are just thankful he has been released."" Hindman would invariably greet everyone he met with a broad grin and make them feel welcome and liked. ""I just think it was his nature,"" Axie Hindman said. ""He was just a very happy person."" Along with his wife, Hindman is survived by a son, Darwin Hindman III, who is an attorney in Nashville, and daughter Ellen Thomas, a pediatrician in Columbia. Services are planned for 1 p.m. Saturday at Calvary Episcopal Church, 123 S. Ninth St. Hindman will be buried in Columbia Cemetery. Hindman was an avid advocate of healthy recreation and was most visible on his bicycle. He was honored just before he left office as mayor after 15 years with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the League of American Bicyclists. The Katy Trail, now one of the premier hiking and biking trails in the nation, was created out of the ruins of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas rail line that was damaged severely in a Missouri River flood in 1986. Using a federal rail-banking law, Hindman led the push to obtain the line, found private funding from Edward D. ""Ted"" Jones and overcome landowner objections. ""He had the ability to deal with controversy and criticism and he just had the ability not to let it bother him,"" Axie Hindman said. ""I think he had a tremendous confidence to deal with people and deal with issues."" While mayor, Hindman received national acclaim for obtaining a $22.5 million federal grant to make Columbia more bicycle and pedestrian friendly. Darwin Hindman grew up in Columbia and Axie Hindman grew up in Platte City. They met, she said Monday, on a blind date in 1958. Darwin Hindman was in the Air Force ROTC, was on active duty with the Strategic Air Command and was a captain in the Air Force Reserve. He received a law degree from the University of Missouri and practiced in Columbia until the early 2000s. While Hindman was mayor, the city made major investments in recreational and historic properties, acquiring Stephens Lake Park, Flat Branch Park and the John William 'Blind' Boone home. Hindman also was mayor during a period of rapid growth, when Columbia grew in population by almost 3 percent per year. Along with the lifetime achievement award from the bicycle federation, Hindman received an honorary degree from MU in 2014 for his public service and advocacy of a healthy lifestyle. Darwin and Axie Hindman are enrolled in the Boone County Hall of Fame and in 2012, the Darwin and Axie Hindman Discovery Garden was dedicated in Stephens Lake Park. rkeller@columbiatribune.com 573-815-1709 ___ (c)2019 Columbia Daily Tribune, Mo.

shawnee mission school district employee accused of stealing over $12k from district,"OLATHE, Kan. -- A Shawnee Mission School District employee has been charged with stealing more than $12,000 from the district. The alleged theft occurred for over a year. Some of the expenditures, just a few dollars. Law enforcement officials believe that cases like the one involving Mikita Watson-Burton are so important because not only are they thefts from the district but they're stealing from the entire community, too. ""Anytime you have a government or public entity where money is taken, it is basically taking from the taxpayers,"" Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe said. Court records show that from August 2017 until August 2018, prosecutors believe Watson-Burton stole $12,567.73 from the Shawnee Mission School District. As the Secretary of Elementary Services, she was responsible for making purchases for the district's 33 elementary schools and had a district Visa purchasing card to do so. Prosecutors said not only did Watson-Burton allegedly buy things for the schools -- but also for herself, including women's clothes, meals, smoothies and gas. Charges were made to stores like Amazon, Walmart, Hy-Vee, Olive Garden, Science City and Chick-fil-A. Two payments to Burns and McDonnell for a camp and five payments to community colleges for her children were also allegedly found charged to the district's card issued to Watson-Burton. She also allegedly used the card to pay her rent. ""And what we have learned over the years is no matter what safeguards you put into place, there are work-arounds, and if somebody really wants to embezzle money, they will find those opportunities to do it,"" Howe said. When a district employee noticed some odd expenditures on Watson-Burton's district Visa, it triggered an internal audit of her account. In total, court records state Watson-Burton made 174 unauthorized purchases. When confronted, court records say Watson-Burton admitted to buying things from her work computer but said they were mistakes. She claims the purchasing card information was loaded in the computer and would auto-fill when she was buying personal items, but she didn't notice. ""What we see in so many instances is long-term employees who are trusted by small businesses,"" Howe said. ""Allowing them to have freedom to do whatever they want and that is where we see some of the most egregious losses. Because there are nor safeguards in place, no second set of eyes and those are the real tragic ones because many times those businesses end up closing up shop that losses are so devastating."" Watson-Burton had no explanation for the items bought off-site on her district-issued purchasing card. While Howe would not comment on this specific case, he did talk about these types of thefts. ""One of the things we try to teach businesses when we go out and speak to them, just put some safeguards into place that may not avoid all potential losses but will limit those losses,"" Howe said. ""Things like having a second pair of eyes to take a look at it, do an occasional audit of your books to make sure multiple people see the books and approve those processes."" The Shawnee Mission School District has an expense and approval process in place. Anything bought must be documented with a receipt and explanation on a monthly expense report and signed off by a director. According to court records, Watson-Burton's reports were signed off on by her boss, who told police she did not know anything about them. Watson-Burton denies using her boss's credentials to sign in and approve her own expense reports. Watson-Burton and the Shawnee Mission School District declined interviews with FOX4. Editor's note: You may recognize Watson-Burton, as she has been a regular guest on the FOX4 Morning Show.     ©2019 WDAF-TV, Kansas City Visit WDAF-TV, Kansas City at www.fox4kc.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",health,Christian Science Monitor,center
Person arrested after trying to cross security barrier next to White House,"WASHINGTON -- Secret Service agents arrested someone who tried to cross a security barrier next to the White House on Friday night. Officials said it happened on the northwest side of the Treasury Building fence along Pennsylvania Avenue at about 9:10 p.m. The person tried to cross the security barrier and was ""immediately apprehended."" Officials did not release the identity of the suspect but said they are being charged with assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Mason Brayman, the assistant special agent in charge for the U.S. Secret Service, said there was no impact to the White House Security operations. The White House did not immediately issue a comment, and it was unclear if President Donald Trump was in the building at the time. It did appear he was in Washington D.C. at the White House as late as Friday afternoon. He spoke at 3:30 ET from the Rose Garden on expanding healthcare options for small businesses and workers. RELATED: Construction to begin soon on taller White House fence This is not the first time someone has tried to gain entry to the White House by scaling a fence. In fact, in recent years it has become such an issue, the Secret Service is planning a $64 million construction project to almost double the White House fence's current height. It will eventually be a 13-foot, 1-inch (3.96-meter) fence with wider and stronger pickets. The existing fence stands about 6-feet, 6 inches (1.83-meters) tall. Active construction, once it begins in the summer, is expected to continue into 2021, the Secret Service said earlier this month. RELATED: Man sets himself on fire next to the White House In 2014, a man from Texas with a knife climbed the fence, ran across the North Lawn and got into the White House. After that, security put another, shorter fence made of metal bike racks in front of the first actual fence, so jumpers would need to get over two barriers instead of one. In 2015, they added the ""anti-climb"" sharp metal points on top of the existing fence to make it harder to scale, and then restricted access to sidewalks and certain areas south of the White House in 2017 after Trump took office and a man from California with mace got onto the grounds. Previous reporting shows he wandered around for 17 minutes before Secret Service officers found him. The president was at the White House at the time of that incident.

"Mike Pence: 'Of course' migrant children should have toothbrushes, blankets, medicine","Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday acknowledged that ""of course"" toothbrushes, blankets and medicine are necessary basics for children -- despite the Trump administration's legal argument earlier this week that detained migrant children didn't need those items in order to be held in "" safe and sanitary conditions ."" Pence responded to footage of a Department of Justice attorney arguing that ""there's fair reason to find that those things may be part of safe and sanitary,"" before a judge states, ""Not may be, are a part."" CNN's Jake Tapper asked Pence during ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, ""Aren't toothbrushes and blankets and medicine, basic conditions for kids, aren't they a part of how the United States of America, the Trump administration treats children?"" Pence replied, ""Well, of course they are,"" and later added, ""I can't speak to what that lawyer was saying."" The vice president's comments follow CNN reporting of a group of doctors, advocates and lawyers warning of what they say are major health and hygiene problems at several US Customs and Border Protection facilities in Texas. Pence seemed to indicate that such conditions were ""one of the reasons we asked for more bed space"" when negotiating during the federal shutdown, and blamed Democrats. ""Democrats in Congress refused to expand the bed space and the capacity for us to detain people at our borders,"" he said. ""It is one of the reasons why we continue to call on Congress to give (the Department of Homeland Security), Customs and Border Protection additional resources at the border."" Tapper argued that funds currently exist to provide all children at the El Paso facility in question with the necessary hygiene products and blankets, and Pence agreed that ""of course we do."" ""My point is, it's all a part of the appropriations process,"" Pence added, punting to Congress ""to provide additional support to deal with the crisis at our southern border"" and close loopholes exploited by human traffickers. Pence also responded to accounts in The New Yorker made by lawyers who visited a border facility and described sick, dirty and unattended children sleeping on cold floors. Tapper said, ""You're a father, you're a man of faith -- you can't approve of that."" Pence replied, ""No American should approve of this mass influx of people coming across our border. It is overwhelming our system at the southern border."" When pressed on the treatment of the children, Pence acknowledged the ""heartbreaking scene"" he witnessed during his visit to a border facility in Arizona in April, and again slammed human traffickers.",legal arguments,CNN,left
westchester red-light cameras stalls in legislature,"WHITE PLAINS - More red-light cameras aren't coming to Westchester County   at least not yet. Westchester officials asked the state for permission to install up to 50 cameras on county-owned roads, but the state Legislature's session ended last week with the measure stalled. It's the second year in a row the county made the request in the waning days of the legislative session, only for it to go nowhere. FOR SALE: The College of New Rochelle's campus SALES TAX: Increase for Westchester awaits governor's signature This year, it passed the state Senate but never came to a vote of the full state Assembly. Democrats control both houses of the Legislature. The county didn't have a specific plan as to where the cameras would be installed or how much revenue they would've generated. That may have been made it easier for Assembly members to pass on bringing the measure to vote, county Legislator Catherine Borgia said. ""Maybe we should spend a little bit of time, the next six months, kind of thinking exactly how we want to execute it in Westchester,"" said Borgia, an Ossining Democrat who chairs the county Budget and Appropriations Committee. ""We'll probably be working on that and giving this another try in the legislative session next year."" If it's implemented in the middle of 2020 instead of at the start, it would mean less potential revenue in the county budget. County Executive George Latimer, a Democrat, has said he supported red light cameras as part of an effort to stabilize Westchester's shaky budgets without relying on property taxes. Westchester pays the highest property taxes in the nation, according to some measures, with the average tax bill more than $17,000. Latimer came into office in 2018 after several years of the county property tax being kept flat. But balancing budgets became increasingly difficult, with reserve funds dwindling and an ongoing reliance on borrowing and one-shot revenue sources such as sale of land. Westchester's request for the cameras came June 17, two days before the end of the state session in Albany. The county Board of Legislators' Republican Minority Leader John Testa said he opposed it at the time because of the lack of details. On Monday, he applauded that the measure didn't go through. ""I am very pleased that our state representatives listened to our objections regarding the installation of red light cameras on Westchester County roads,"" Testa said. ""I urge the administration to find new and constructive forms of revenue generation instead of taking more money out of the pockets of our residents."" Latimer wasn't available for comment Monday afternoon. Ben Boykin, chairman of the county Board of Legislators, didn't return a call seeking comment. The state Legislature has to give authority for red-light cameras, which are already in use in Yonkers, White Plains, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon. The cameras are often criticized as a cash grab for revenue-strapped municipalities, while others say they actually increase the potential for accidents because drivers slam on their brakes at intersections. Supporters say the cameras can improve safety at dangerous intersections. Westchester roads are owned by a number of different entities, but the request would only give authority for local roads that are owned by Westchester. Red light cameras were one of several asks by the county to state government. A one percentage point increase in sales tax outside made it through the Legislature but still needs a signature from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. If that increase goes through, Latimer has said he'd propose two county budgets in a row that keep the tax levy flat. The potential increase would not affect Yonkers, New Rochelle, White Plains and Mount Vernon, which already pay at least 1 percentage point more overall than the rest of the county.

How to turn off Google Maps' many notifications,"Judging by the flood of notifications I get on a daily basis from Google Maps, it really likes me   maybe a little too much. If you use Google Maps on Android, you might be in the same boat. Google Maps has a lot of notification options (between 40 and 54 nestled into 10 categories in the three phones that we tried out), and they're all turned on by default. When I look down the list, I find a few crucial notifications in the mix, like the one that lets me know my train schedule before I leave for work. But I find most of the others to be trivial and annoying to deal with, constantly stacking up in my notification tray and distracting me from other important notifications. (Note: This isn't an issue for people who use iPhones. It's just a little treat from Google to those who use the navigation app on the company's own OS.) No matter which Android phone you use, the Maps app lets you turn notifications off one by one. But there's a faster, easier way to filter all of those notifications if you use a phone that runs on Android 9 Pie software. You'll find all of the steps below. Before you get started, note that the location of some menu items may vary slightly depending on the brand of phone you use. On any Android phone with Google Maps installed Open Google Maps, then tap the menu button in the top left corner of your screen Scroll down, then select ""Settings"" Once you're here, find and tap on ""Notifications"" Here, you'll see each of the notifications categories. You can open each one to deactivate any notification that doesn't seem useful. On phones running Android 9 Pie software Long-press on the Google Maps app icon, then tap the ""i"" (information) button. This will take you directly to the ""App info"" page. Tap ""Notifications"" Here, all of those notifications are divided into separate categories, so you can scroll through the categories and deactivate whole sections of unessential notifications. You can also deactivate individual notifications within each category. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

the national park service is in a $12b maintenance hole. now it's diverting millions to trump's fourth of july plans,"The National Park Service will redirect at least $2.5 million in visitor fees to help cover costs for military flyovers and other elements of President Donald Trump's ""Salute to America"" Fourth of July event -- money the NPS would otherwise be able to put toward more than $12 billion in unaddressed maintenance at parks across the country. A spokesman for the National Mall and Memorial Parks confirmed the transfer of funds to WUSA9 on Wednesday. The money will come from visitor fees collected at national parks across the country. According to NPS, approximately 80 percent of those fees normally stay at the park where they're collected to be used for repair, maintenance and facility enhancement. At Prince William Forest Park in Virginia, for example, visitor fees were used to fund a multi-million dollar waterline project and to convert the park's outdated radio systems, according to the NPS' ""Your Dollars At Work"" portal . Nationwide, the National Park Service is experiencing an estimated $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog. In the fiscal year 2020 budget alone, NPS identified 26 high priority projects across the country in need of approximately $178.6 million in maintenance   more than $113 million of which is deferred maintenance that has been continually put off due to budget constraints. RELATED: Report: $2.5 million in funds to fix national parks diverted to Trump July 4th event Those projects include critically needed repairs at some of the country's most recognizable national parks, as well as several park locations in the D.C. area, among them: $9.2 million to rehabilitate Fort Wood, the granite fort that houses the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. Without such maintenance, NPS warns the structure's ""durability and even stability could become compromised."" $6.9 million to eliminate water penetration and replace failing drainage elements at Meridian Hill Park in Washington, D.C. Without the repairs, the park would suffer ""irreparable damage"" to historic features within three years, NPS says. $24 million for two projects at Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park in D.C. and Maryland to remediate rock fall hazards and reconstruct and stabilize a historic wall and towpath. If no action is taken, NPS says rockfall hazards will force a closure that will make the path completely inaccessible for the 250,000 cyclists that travel the towpath each year. President Trump's proposed fiscal year 2020 budget would provide $160 million for some of the National Parks Service's highest-priority maintenance projects, but would represent an overall cut of more than $480 million from the agency's 2019 budget. RELATED: Trump creates exclusivity at the Lincoln Memorial with VIP tickets for July 4th Fireworks display On top of regular budget issues, the National Parks Service suffered a loss of millions of dollars in revenue during the government shutdown earlier this year. The 35-day shutdown was the longest in history -- costing NPS an estimated $400,000 in visitor fees a day, or about $14 million over the entire shutdown. Additionally, no maintenance or cleaning was conducted during the shutdown --exacerbating existing issues and creating new ones to be addressed. The National Park Service would receive some relief under the U.S. House's proposed appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, which lays out $649 million more for NPS than President Trump's proposed 2020 budget. The bill has yet to be approved by the full House.

Chicago Virtual Charter School CEO On Paid Leave As CPS Watchdog Investigates Questionable Spending,"CHICAGO (CBS)   The CEO of Chicago Virtual Charter School is in deep trouble, and others could be too, amid investigation into questionable spending. Class might be over for the summer, but officials at the Chicago Public Schools continue to study what went on at Chicago Virtual Charter school during the 2018-19 school year. CVCS remains on the district's charter school warning list, and more disciplinary action might be on the way. CPS Inspector General Nicholas Schuler said he's launched an investigation after the CBS 2 Morning Insiders uncovered questionable spending by administrators. For example, CEO Dr. Cheryl Pruitt received a 15 percent raise, bringing her salary to $176,000, even though CPS had placed the school on financial and academic probation. Since CBS 2 reported on the school's financial issues in March, parents said Pruitt has been proving herself. ""I saw her try to reach the parents in order to get us together, looking for parents' support; which is something that is lacking here,"" Michele Gomez said. The board of directors might disagree. They placed Pruitt on paid leave, and didn't even mention her during Wednesday's board meeting. ""Do we have a CEO? Do we not? Is she coming back? Is she not? I think they owe that to the parents,"" Gomez said. CBS 2 has learned CVCS is in the midst of its own independent financial investigation. CPS leaders said they instructed the charter school's board to ""take appropriate employment action up to and including termination against any school officials that are the subject of allegations."" CVCS board president Ken Speller declined to discuss Pruitt's current status. ""Because it's a personnel matter, it's confidential,"" he said. Asked if the board will be voting on possible termination anytime soon, he said ""there's no discussion of terminations at this time."" Speller also was mum on why he voted against two of three parents who wanted to join the board. He said he was the one who called the CPS inspector general's office to investigate the school. ""I reached out to them first,"" he said. However, Pruitt wouldn't say what he asked the inspector general to investigate. ""Again, a personnel matter. It's confidential. I can't discuss it with you,"" he said. CBS 2 also has revealed the school was using thousands of taxpayer dollars to shuttle director of strategy Angela Richardson-Bryant between Chicago and her home in Atlanta. Schuler wouldn't budge when asked if he is looking into that, saying only there is an ""active investigation"" at the school.",legal arguments,CBS,left

At least seven killed as freak storm lashes Greek resorts,"NEA PLAGIA, Greece, July 11 (Reuters) - At least seven people, including six tourists, were killed and more than 100 others injured when a violent, short-lived storm lashed northern Greece overnight, felling trees and ripping off rooftops. Witnesses said the storm had come and gone in a matter of minutes. Winds of over 100 kph (60 mph) were reported on the Halkidiki peninsula, popular with tourists in the summer. Two elderly Czech tourists were killed when strong winds and water overturned their travel trailer, police said. A woman and an eight-year-old boy from Romania were killed when a roof collapsed on a restaurant in the beach resort of Nea Plagia. And a man and a young boy, both Russians, died when a tree fell near their hotel in the seaside town of Potidea, authorities said. A seventh, unidentified victim's body was found in the sea. ""It was so windy ...it is really disastrous,"" said a Serbian tourist who gave his name as Bratislav. The storm was a ""supercell"", Theodoros Karakostas, a professor of metereology and climatology at Aristotelion University, told the state Athens News Agency. ""It's a rare phenomenon,"" he said. Supercells are the least common kind of thunderstorm, but the most violent. Nefeli Minovgidou, a Greek tourist, described the scene as chaotic. ""Chairs were flying everywhere, trees were falling .. everyone inside was screaming, it was chaos,"" she told Reuters. Streets in the area were dotted with uprooted pine trees and overturned motorcycles. Wooden rooftops were torn off and dumped on beaches. A Reuters correspondent saw sun loungers strewn in mangled heaps with other debris across Nea Plagia's beaches. ""ABRUPT AND SUDDEN"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government was sworn in this week after winning elections on July 7, cancelled his schedule and was being continually briefed, a government official said. Civil Protection Minister Mihalis Chrisochoidis, at the scene, said Greece was mourning the loss of life, adding: ""In coming days all damage will be repaired."" Such severe storms are unusual in Greece, where summers are usually hot and dry. But the tragedy had echoes of a wildfire almost a year ago that raced through the resort of Mati with little warning. Fanned by hot winds, it trapped many inhabitants before they could flee and killed 100 people. ""It is the first time in my 25-year career that I have lived through something like this,"" Athansios Kaltsas, director of the Nea Moudania Medical Centre, where many of the injured were treated for fractures, told Greek television. ""It was so abrupt, and so sudden."" Kaltsas said patients taken to the clinic ranged in age from eight months to over 70. Some had head injuries from trees and other falling objects. Authorities said around 100 people, mostly tourists, had been injured, and 23 had been admitted to hospital. There were widespread power cuts. ""Here we dealing with a new situation,"" geology and natural disasters expert Efthymios Lekkas told Skai TV. ""Climate change is an accelerated and self-sustaining cycle that creates new hazards, with increased duration and intensity.""

A US Air Force A-10 accidentally dropped bombs on Florida after hitting a bird,"A US Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt crashed into a bird over Florida on Monday, causing it to inadvertently release three training munitions over the state. The BDU-33s - 25-pound inert bombs - are not explosive, although they do have a pyrotechnic charge that can be dangerous. There were no reported injuries or damages, and the incident is under investigation. The Air Force is apparently still looking for the dropped munitions. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. A US Air Force A-10C Thunderbolt II out of Moody Air Force Base in Georgia accidentally dropped training bombs on Florida after hitting a bird, the 23rd Wing Public Affairs Office said in a statement. The Moody attack aircraft assigned to the 23d Fighter Group ""suffered a bird strike which caused an inadvertent release of three BDU-33s,"" 25-pound non-explosive training munitions used to simulate the 500-pound M1a-82 bomb, the statement said . The dummy munitions fell somewhere off Highway 129 near Suwannee Springs in northern Florida. The Air Force is apparently still looking for the bombs. The service has instructed anyone who comes across them to keep their distance, explaining that while the weapons are inert, they do have a small pyrotechnic charge that could be dangerous. There were no reported damages or injuries, and the incident is under investigation. Birds are a serious problem for the US military, as they cause millions of dollars in damage a year.

Wilson went to the store to buy a gift for his son's birthday. The Philadelphia FOP is offering a $10,000 reward for any information that leads to the arrest of the vandal. ""It's sickening and disgusting that some low-life would deface the mural of hero and fallen-officer, Robert Wilson III,"" said FOP Lodge #5 President John McNesby.

Stating this is not to take away from the shaming and defacement of Sgt. Wilson's mural. It has enhanced the ignorance and disrespect shown toward our officers as the consequences of such are as minuscule as a slap on the wrist.

Military woman slain with kids became citizen at White House,"NEW YORK (AP)   A U.S. military member who became an American citizen during a 2012 White House ceremony has been slain along with her two toddlers, and the children's father has been arrested. Alla Ausheva, 2-year-old Ivan Walker and 3-year-old Elia Walker were found dead Saturday in their Staten Island home. Ausheva, 37, had obtained a protective order against the 36-year-old suspect, Shane Walker, but it was no longer in effect, The New York Times reported. Ausheva moved from Saint Petersburg, Russia, to Queens in 2011 and soon joined the New York Army National Guard. In 2014, she transferred to the Air National Guard. She was serving full time on active duty with a homeland security force based at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, according to a military spokeswoman. She became a U.S. citizen on July 4, 2012. ""All of you did something profound: You chose to serve,"" then Democratic President Barack Obama told Ausheva and 24 other immigrant service members during the naturalization ceremony. ""You put on the uniform of a country that was not yet fully your own. You displayed the values that we celebrate every Fourth of July   duty, responsibility and patriotism."" She also was passionate about music. ""She was a very determined young woman; she was charming and so enthusiastic,"" said Linda Amiel Burns, founder of a workshop called The Singing Experience. A Youtube video shows Ausheva performing in Russian and English. ""One year ago I moved from Russia. That's when my first dream came true,"" Ausheva said onstage. ""Then in the summer I joined the U.S. Army. That's when my second dream came true. Now, I'm singing on a real stage and not in the shower. My third dream came true. And now I wonder what's next."" A comment she made during a song introduction now bears added poignancy: ""Sometimes life separates us from the person we love and all we have are our memories."" The father of her children, Walker, also served in the Army National Guard and later joined the Air National Guard, working as a vehicle operator, officials said. He was hospitalized over the weekend after being found walking along a highway. He had not yet been arraigned on Monday, according to the Staten Island district attorney's office.

Third shooting death in four days prompts fear in La Puente community,"Fear has spread across the small city of La Puente after a third fatal shooting in just four days, and residents are worried there may be more deaths, authorities said. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said deputies responded just before 3 p.m. Monday to the 15400 block of Temple Avenue and found a man with a gunshot wound to his torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Sheriff's officials said they don't have a description of any suspects in Monday's attack, the third in recent days. Less than 24 hours earlier, a man died after being shot at least once in the upper torso in a triple shooting in the 400 block of Tonopah Avenue. The man, who has not been identified, died at the scene. Two other men were injured in the shooting, one struck twice in the upper torso, and the other in the hand. Both were taken to a hospital. Deputies described the shooters as two men driving a silver or dark-colored SUV. On Friday night, 31-year-old David Peter Juarez, suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to his back, in a sidewalk shooting in the 100 block of North Winton Avenue, authorities said. Juarez died at the scene. A 22-year-old man was shot in the upper torso in the same incident and taken to a hospital, authorities said. Sheriff's officials do not have any information about a suspect in that shooting. All three attacks happened within five miles of one other. In the past several years, reports show La Puente has had only one or two homicides annually. According to data from the FBI, sheriff's officials didn't report any homicide investigations in La Puente in 2015 and 2017. Just one homicide was investigated in 2016. According to the L.A. Times Homicide Report, two homicides occurred in 2018. Community members have expressed concern on Twitter that the shootings seem to be happening at all hours of the day, and some think they are the result of gang initiations. Sheriff's officials said they don't know whether the slayings are gang-related. Residents also worry about the shootings in light of the city's upcoming Fourth of July fireworks show. Some have urged neighbors to skip the annual celebration, while others said they are considering moving out of La Puente altogether. ""Every year I go to La Puente firework show but with all the shooting happening, I'm about to stay … home,"" one commenter said on social media. All three homicides are under investigation.

Trayvon Martin's mom says Hillary Clinton 'planted the seed' for her to run for office in Florida,"WASHINGTON   The mother of slain teenager Trayvon Martin is running for a local office in Florida and says one of the driving factors behind her decision to enter the race was helping out on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Sybrina Fulton, who became a prominent advocate after the 2012 shooting death of her 17-year-old son by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., announced her candidacy for Miami-Dade County Commission last month. In an interview with The Hill's Hill.TV, Fulton said campaigning for Clinton throughout the 2016 election ""pushed me in the right direction."" She said it got her thinking and researching what position and seat she'd be best suited for and where she could make the most difference in her community.

""It kind of planted the seed for me, but I still wasn't ready until I prayed on it, and it took almost a year in order for me to decide to run.""

44 Fifth Third Branches Are Closing in Chicago Area,"CHICAGO, IL -- Fifth Third Bank plans to close 44 Chicago-area branches in July. Bank officials said most of the soon-to-be shuttered banks have other Fifth Third locations less than a mile from the branches that are slated to close, according to media reports.

federal judges send 2020 census lawsuit back to lower court,"BALTIMORE (AP)   A lawsuit that alleges a 2020 census question pushed by the Trump administration violates minorities' rights will be sent back to a federal court in Maryland so new evidence can be considered, U.S. appeals judges ruled Tuesday. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision comes a day after U.S. District Judge George Hazel of Maryland suggested in an opinion that racial discrimination and partisan power plays could be the underlying motives in asking everyone in the country about citizenship status. The 4th Circuit's order sending the case back to Hazel could be pivotal. ""The decision today opens up a potentially new legal front in the fight against the citizenship question,"" said Thomas Wolf, counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice and an expert on census matters. The Supreme Court is expected to decide this week whether the Trump administration can add its citizenship question to the 2020 population survey. However, the justices are not considering legal questions about whether the citizenship addition might be discriminatory. Now that the 4th Circuit has sent this lawsuit back to the federal court in Maryland, Hazel could issue an injunction blocking the citizenship question. If that were to happen, the order issued by the lower court would have to hold until the Supreme Court can take up the matter, according to Wolf. And because the Supreme Court does not generally hear arguments again until October after this week's decisions, there would be more time for the 4th Circuit to hear an appeal, said Jennifer Nou, a University of Chicago law professor. ""Who will be the 'final word' depends on the true deadline for when the census forms must be printed. If the true deadline for the census forms occurs before the Supreme Court reconvenes, for example, there is a chance that the 4th Circuit could be the final word,"" Nou said in an email. The Trump administration insists that printing of census questionnaires is supposed to begin July 1. It wants justices to resolve the citizenship question swiftly in its favor, essentially cutting off additional proceedings in court in Maryland and New York and allowing the census forms to be printed with the new question. Even before the 4th Circuit issued its order, the U.S. Justice Department was urging the Supreme Court to ignore the evidence Hazel says merits further review. ""It is based on a speculative conspiracy theory that is unsupported by the evidence and legally irrelevant to demonstrating that (Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross) acted with a discriminatory intent,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco, Trump's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a Tuesday letter to the court. But in his court filing Monday, Hazel reasoned that the trove of new evidence ""potentially connects the dots between a discriminatory purpose   diluting Hispanics' political power   and Secretary Ross's decision"" to include the citizenship question. The new evidence consists of computer documents from Republican operative Tom Hofeller, who died last year. They include detailed calculations projecting gains Republicans would see in Texas by basing legislative districts on the number of voting-age citizens rather than the total population. The late North Carolina redistricting expert said in the documents that GOP gains would be possible only if the census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, said in a memo last year that the Justice Department wants to ask the question to gather data to help identify majority-minority congressional districts, which the Voting Rights Act calls for when possible. In his opinion issued a day before the 4th Circuit's order, Hazel said he would reopen discovery for 45 days, order an evidentiary hearing and issue a ""speedy ruling."" ___ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

"Dozens living in filthy, unsafe commercial building are evacuated","The rooms in the commercial South L.A. building were so covered in trash and clothing that, in some cases, you could not see the floor. A rancid smell permeated the building, flies buzzed around trash and children's toys were scattered about. It was an appalling sight for officials who responded Friday morning to the 800 block of West 57th Street to evacuate dozens of people living there illegally. The evacuation was planned by Councilman Curren D. Price Jr., whose fieldworkers learned about the living conditions by talking to community members, said Angelina Valencia, the councilman's communications director. A task force created by Price's office worked to gather city departments and ensure the people living inside would be housed. Valencia said 30 people so far have accepted temporary housing in shelters and motels. By 9 a.m., the Los Angeles Fire Department had evacuated 16 people, including multiple children, said LAFD Capt. Branden Silverman. As officials boarded up most of the doors and windows, dozens more people were expected to return to pick up their belongings, he said. The living conditions were ""not healthy or safe,"" he said. ""It wasn't designed to be inhabited."" For months, the building has been without water, gas or electricity, and it appeared a makeshift electrical system was created, with extension cords on the walls and floors, he said. ""People were sleeping anywhere they could,"" Silverman said, adding that mattresses covered the floors of the building. ""There were all kinds of things you would see in a regular house, just very cluttered and strewn about."" There were no toilets, that he could see, save for a children's portable toilet. In a kitchen area in the middle of the building, at least five refrigerators lined the walls. Some of the people who evacuated told news outlets at the scene that they had been paying up to $700 in rent to live in the dismal conditions , though it's unclear who, if anyone, was managing the property. Some of the residents were elderly or had mental illnesses, Valencia said. One woman living there was pregnant. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, Children and Family Services, counselors and other city departments were at the facility through Friday morning and will continue to help those evacuated with additional help they may need, Valencia said. The councilman, she said, wanted to make sure ""the families are not left out on the street."" The building, which officials thought was once a church, had been sold months earlier, although its front signage still reads ""New Heaven & Earth Christian Cntr Hope."" alejandra.reyesvelarde@latimes.com Twitter: @r_valejandra",health,Los Angeles Times,left
"1-year-old boy dies in Texas after being left in hot car, police say; 13th death nationally in 2019","A 1-year-old child died Saturday after being left inside a hot car in Texas for about five hours, police said. This is the 13th case of a child dying of heat exhaustion in ovenlike cars nationally this year, according to NoHeatStroke.org, with the hottest months of the year still to come. A parent left the child in their Chevrolet Tahoe when they went to work at 11 a.m., the Galveston Police Department told The Houston Chronicle . When the parent returned around 4 p.m., the boy was unresponsive. With the high reaching 92 degrees Saturday, experts said the air temperature in the truck likely exceeded 135 degrees. Fatal facts: Hot cars can hit deadly, oven-like temperatures in as little as one hour Medical staff pronounced the boy dead at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. An investigation is ongoing and no names have been released. Saturday's case came two days after a 4-year-old child died in a hot car about 300 miles away in Providence Village, Texas, according to NoHeatStroke.org . The high reached 98 degrees that day. An average of 38 children die while trapped in hot vehicles every year, according to Jan Null, an adjunct professor of meteorology at San Jose State University. A record 52 children died last year. Milestone: In the past 20 years, 800 children died while trapped inside oven-like cars Since 1998, 54% of U.S. children who died in a hot car were forgotten by a parent or child in a vehicle. Children have difficultly escaping a hot car on their own, and their respiratory and circulatory systems can't handle heat as well as those of adults. Direct sunlight heats objects inside cars, so temperatures inside cars can soar as high as 130 degrees, even when external temperatures are much lower. The body's natural cooling methods, such as sweating, begin to shut down once the body's core temperature reaches around 104 degrees. Death can occur at 107 degrees. July is usually the deadliest month for children in hot cars, with a record 16 deaths in 1999, Null previously told USA TODAY.

marijuana will soon be legal in illinois. what does that mean for iowans?,"Recreational marijuana will soon be legal across the Mississippi River in Illinois. On Tuesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed a bill legalizing the possession and use of marijuana, and expunging the criminal records of people with minor pot possession convictions. That means adults ages 21 and older   including Iowans visiting the ""Land of Lincoln""   will be able to purchase marijuana from licensed sellers and use it while in the state starting Jan. 1, 2020. Illinois joins 10 other states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana: Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Nevada, Vermont and Washington. Recreational marijuana use remains illegal in Iowa. Here's what Iowans should know about the new Illinois law and what it might mean for you: What does the law allow? Illinois residents will be able to purchase up 1 ounce of raw cannabis as well as cannabis-infused products, such as edibles or tinctures, that contain no more than 500 milligrams of THC, the chemical that makes users high. Can Iowans buy marijuana in Illinois? Non-Illinois residents, including Iowans, can purchase and possess half the amount residents are allowed to possess. Just don't bring it back across state lines. The possession and sale of marijuana are still illegal at the federal level as well as in Iowa. Selling marijuana in the state is currently a felony, punishable by up to 50 years in prison. Will there be marijuana dispensaries in Illinois? Yes. Licensed dispensaries will be the only place where you can legally buy recreational marijuana if the law goes into effect. Illinois, which began selling medical marijuana in 2015, now has 55 such dispensaries. Those dispensaries can apply to sell pot for recreational use, too, and the new law also allows them to open a second location for that purpose. According to The Chicago Tribune , some dispensaries are already planning building expansions, staffing increases and new technology to handle the recreational marijuana customers and an expected increase in medical marijuana sales. Where could you legally use recreational weed in Illinois? Under the new law, people will be able to smoke or consume edibles in their homes, as well as in certain cannabis-related businesses. However, marijuana use will still be prohibited in these places: Any public place, including streets or parks. In motor vehicles. Near someone under 21. On school grounds, except for medical marijuana users. Its use also could be prohibited on private properties, at the owners' discretion. We're here when you need us. But we need you, too. Subscribe today. What's the marijuana situation in Iowa? While recreational marijuana is banned, Iowa allows patients to use cannabidiol for certain medical conditions, including epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's and Parkinson's disease. The medical cannabidiol act was first passed in 2014 and updated in 2017 to include a manufacturing and dispensary system. This spring, the Iowa Legislature passed a bill that would have further expanded the program, removing a 3% cap on THC in medical marijuana products. However, the legislation was vetoed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds last month. ""Ultimately, I believe Iowa must proceed cautiously to ensure that any expansion of our medical (cannabidiol) program is thoughtful and deliberate,"" Reynolds said. What does the federal government say about marijuana? Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, but since 2014, federal prosecutors have generally ignored marijuana sales in the states that have legalized its use. Reporters Kellie Hwang and Andrew Clark of IndyStar and Trevor Hughes of USA TODAY contributed to this story. Editor's note: This story has been updated. Doctors do not prescribe cannabidiol​​​​​​​ under Iowa law. This article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: Marijuana will soon be legal in Illinois.

Scientists amazed as Canadian permafrost thaws 70 years early,"By Matthew Green LONDON (Reuters) - Permafrost at outposts in the Canadian Arctic is thawing 70 years earlier than predicted, an expedition has discovered, in the latest sign that the global climate crisis is accelerating even faster than scientists had feared. A team from the University of Alaska Fairbanks said they were astounded by how quickly a succession of unusually hot summers had destabilized the upper layers of giant subterranean ice blocks that had been frozen solid for millennia. ""What we saw was amazing,"" Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the university, told Reuters by telephone. ""It's an indication that the climate is now warmer than at any time in the last 5,000 or more years."" With governments meeting in Bonn this week to try to ratchet up ambitions in United Nations climate negotiations, the team's findings, published on June 10 in Geophysical Research Letters, offered a further sign of a growing climate emergency. The paper was based on data Romanovsky and his colleagues had been analyzing since their last expedition to the area in 2016. The team used a modified propeller plane to visit exceptionally remote sites, including an abandoned Cold War-era radar base more than 300 km from the nearest human settlement. Diving through a lucky break in the clouds, Romanovsky and his colleagues said they were confronted with a landscape that was unrecognizable from the pristine Arctic terrain they had encountered during initial visits a decade or so earlier. The vista had dissolved into an undulating sea of hummocks - waist-high depressions and ponds known as thermokarst. Vegetation, once sparse, had begun to flourish in the shelter provided from the constant wind. Torn between professional excitement and foreboding, Romanovsky said the scene had reminded him of the aftermath of a bombardment. ""It's a canary in the coalmine,"" said Louise Farquharson, a post-doctoral researcher and co-author of the study. ""It's very likely that this phenomenon is affecting a much more extensive region and that's what we're going to look at next."" Scientists are concerned about the stability of permafrost because of the risk that rapid thawing could release vast quantities of heat-trapping gases, unleashing a feedback loop that would in turn fuel even faster temperature rises. Even if current commitments to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement are implemented, the world is still far from averting the risk that these kinds of feedback loops will trigger runaway warming, according to models used by the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. With scientists warning that sharply higher temperatures would devastate the global south and threaten the viability of industrial civilization in the northern hemisphere, campaigners said the new paper reinforced the imperative to cut emissions. ""Thawing permafrost is one of the tipping points for climate breakdown and it's happening before our very eyes,"" said Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International. ""This premature thawing is another clear signal that we must decarbonize our economies, and immediately.""

Howell Station neighbors call foul on plans for gas station near Beltline corridor,"An aging auto repair shop on Howell Station's West Marietta Street is slated to be razed and replaced with a four-pump gas station, and some neighbors aren't happy about it. The property sits at the corner of West Marietta and Rice streets, just east of the under-construction Westside Park at Bellwood Quarry. It's part of the Beltline Overlay District, neighboring a section of single-family homes. A segment of the Beltline's Westside Trail is expected to run just west of the proposed gas station in coming years, via what are now lanes of West Marietta Street. Nina Gentry, a representative for the property owner, filed an application for a Special Administrative Permit with the City of Atlanta zoning office May 13. But some neighbors living near the proposal, namely members of the Howell Station Neighborhood Association, say plans for the new gas station and convenience store need to fizzle out. ""Obviously, this is not a use we support due to the quality-of-life issues presented by a gas station abutting single-family residential, proximity to the Beltline, as well as traffic at that intersection being already difficult to navigate,"" reads an email the organization's board sent to city and Beltline officials and provided to Curbed Atlanta. The board concedes that service stations are allowed in the Beltline Overlay District, but a member of the board, who asked to remain anonymous, said they'd previously told Gentry the proposed project ""is clearly the opposite"" of what they'd like to see at the property. Gentry could not be reached for comment by press time, and this story will be updated should we receive a response to inquiries. Additionally, per the neighborhood source, the current zoning designation prohibits the construction of a gas station. Via the zoning code: Transitional uses: Where a lot in this district abuts a lot in any R-1 through R-G district at the side along the same street frontage, and without an intervening street, the first lot within this district, or the first 100 feet of such lot if it is wider than 100 feet, shall not be used for any secured-storage facility, drive-in facility, car wash, service station, mortuary or funeral home, sales lot for automobiles, or body shop. ""Unfortunately, service stations are allowed in the Beltline Overlay, but they must conform to all of the streetscape regulations, including not locating pumps between the building and the street,"" said the source. ""This site may not be considered to be bound by three streets as a single-family residential property extends [next to] the existing body shop."" The source asserted that the developers are attempting to ""creatively replat the lot to pretend there's a buffer lot adjacent to the [residences], and they're trying to claim the existing body shop is actually a service station and therefore grandfathered in.""

mitsotakis sworn in as greek prime minister after big win,"ATHENS, Greece (AP)   Conservative party leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been sworn in as Greece's new prime minister Monday, a day after his resounding win over left-wing Alexis Tsipras, who led the country through the tumultuous final years of its international bailouts. Mitsotakis, 51, arrived at the presidential mansion for the official swearing-in ceremony accompanied by his wife and three children, with the ceremony conducted by Archbishop of Athens Ieronymos. He was to then head to the prime minister's office for a handover of duties, and was expected to name his cabinet later in the day. Mitsotakis' New Democracy party won 39.8% of the vote, giving him 158 seats in the 300-member parliament, a comfortable governing majority. Tsipras' Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, garnered 31.5%. The extremist right-wing Golden Dawn, Greece's third largest party during the height of the financial crisis, failed to make the 3% threshold to enter parliament. Mitsotakis will have to move fast to deal with the myriad of problems still plaguing the economy. Europe's finance ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday and will be discussing Greece, which still has stringent fiscal targets to meet even though it no longer directly receives bailout loans. ""I assume the governance of the country with full awareness of the national responsibility,"" Mitsotakis said in his victory speech Sunday night. ""I know of the difficulties that lie ahead for me and for my associates. But I draw strength from the strength of the people."" Greece's economy shrank by a quarter and poverty and unemployment levels soared during the country's nearly decade-long financial crisis. Although its finances are on the mend and the economy is expected to grow by 2.2% this year, it still has a long way to go to make up the economic output lost. The country's debt stands at about 181% of annual GDP and Greece has pledged to continue producing large primary surpluses   the budget excluding debt servicing   of more than 3% of GDP for years to come. Mitsotakis said Sunday he would stick to his campaign pledges of lowering taxes, attracting investments and cutting through red tape to make Greece more business-friendly. ""New Democracy's clear victory in Greece's parliamentary elections yesterday will be welcomed by investors,"" said economics consultancy Capital Economics in a research note. ""But it will not be a game changer for the economy, not least because the government will still be constrained by its membership of the single currency and its 'surveillance' agreement with the EU."" That caution was evident in the performance of the main stock market in Athens, which was down 1.4 percent in midday trading Monday as investors booked profits generated during the recent rally that was largely based on expectations of a Mitsotakis victory. Mitsotakis will also have to contend with pension increases and other benefits the outgoing government granted ahead of European elections in May   benefits which European creditors had warned could make Greece's fiscal targets hard to meet. ""Although Greece exited its third bailout in mid-2018, it is subject to 'enhanced surveillance' which bears a striking resemblance to a bail-out program,"" Capital Economics said. ""For example, the government will get further relief on the cost of servicing its public debt only if it sticks to tight fiscal policy.""",science,The Washington Post,left
Live rat falls from ceiling and lands on table at Buffalo Wild Wings,"A customer at a Buffalo Wild Wings in California was recently met with something wild that wasn't a wing   a live rat that fell from the ceiling, forcing the restaurant to temporarily shut down. Alisha Norman said she was watching the Women's World Cup soccer game at Buffalo Wild Wings in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles with friends on Thursday when a rat fell onto a neighboring table. ""So what do you do when a rat falls from the ceiling onto your table?"" Norman wrote in a Facebook post accompanied with photos of the rat resting atop a menu. ""Really LA? I was just trying to watch the soccer game."" Norman, who lives in Houston, Texas, was vacationing in California for a few days to celebrate her 43rd birthday. She said she had yet to order when she heard something overhead. ""I knew the rat was going to be injured because it hit like a Mack truck,"" she told NBC Los Angeles . ""It was big."" Norman said she requested a manager who scooped up the rat using two plates and dumped it into a garbage bag. ""It was kind of sad really,"" Norman told NBC News. When the manager turned the rat upright, it was clear it couldn't move, according to Norman. ""It was terrible,"" she said. ""It was disgusting."" Norman did not order any food but said some of her friends did and their meals were complimentary to make up for the lunchtime fallout. Buffalo Wild Wings said the ""isolated incident"" was unfortunate and construction at Howard Hughes Center, where the restaurant is located, was to blame. ""The center where the restaurant is located is undergoing significant construction and we are confident it was directly related,"" the company said in a statement. The company said it closed the restaurant for proper remediation, cleaning and sanitization. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health told NBC News ""Buffalo Wild Wings took appropriate action to voluntarily close their facility to investigate and ensure that there was no ongoing imminent health hazard,"" adding that an inspection of the facility is planned before it reopens.

"top u.s. counterterror official warns of ""complacency"" as isis spreads","Although the U.S. has not seen a large-scale terrorism attack on its soil in almost two decades, threats from several extremist organizations persist and some trends are ""ominous,"" says Russ Travers, the deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""When I testify [before Congress] now, 'complacency' is a word that I use a lot, because I do worry that we are a bit of a victim of our own success,"" Travers said. ""There's a bit of a fatigue factor, I think, settling in with terrorism in general."" ""There are a lot of ominous trends out there,"" he continued. ""And the key question now is going to be the extent to which we reallocate resources and attention away from terrorism."" In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, Travers said he was in ""complete agreement"" with the country's strategic shift, as described in the 2018 National Defense Strategy, from a focus on counterterrorism objectives to one on competition with Russia and China. ""We just need to be careful that we don't take our eye off the ball when it comes to terrorism,"" he told Morell. ""We need to ensure that we don't go too far and undermine our capabilities and put us back in kind of a pre-9/11 state."" Travers pointed to the evolving threat from ISIS, which, since the collapse of its territorial caliphate earlier this year, has reconstituted a core group of leadership in other areas. ""[T]hey've known that this has been coming for a couple of years, and so they've been planning for it,"" Travers said. ""[T]hey're operating in insurgent cells."" He estimated that just over 14,000 ISIS fighters continue to operate in Iraq and Syria   an ""order of magnitude more people than ISIS had six, seven years ago at the beginning of the insurgency,"" he said   but that the network has spread to more than 20 countries. ""The global nature of this can't be overestimated,"" he told Morell. ""[T]his is going to be a concern for us for a very long while."" Local insurgencies throughout Africa, for instance, have ""wrapped themselves in the ISIS"" flag, Travers said, presenting new challenges for intelligence gathering. ""It's not an area that we are particularly well-postured to do collection against,"" he told Morell. And while theological differences remain between ISIS and Al-Qaeda, the two groups do occasionally cooperate in areas in West Africa   while fighting against one another in Yemen and Somalia. Of the existing Al-Qaeda offshoots, Travers said, ""I think [Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] in Yemen is probably the greatest long-term concern for us."" Counterterrorism challenges are also being compounded by technological shifts that are fundamentally changing the scope and focus of intelligence collection, Travers told Morell. ""Right now, pretty much every department and agency is going after all the data it possibly can in support of its analysis. That's probably not the most efficient way to do things,"" he said. ""So we've got some really hard questions going forward, I think, because we are all swimming in that ever-increasing size of the haystack. And the needles themselves are getting more subtle.""

Priest restored to East Lakeview parish post after being cleared of Midlothian-based misconduct allegations,"A Catholic priest who faced allegations of sexual impropriety tied to a Midlothian-based parish, where he was first assigned more than four decades ago, was cleared of any wrongdoing. Cardinal Blasé Cupich issued a statement saying that the Rev. Patrick Lee, who was suspended from religious duties in January, was reinstated as pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in the East Lakeview neighborhood. Back when Lee was first ordained as a priest, he served from 1976-79 as an associate pastor at St. Christopher Catholic Church in Midlothian. He has since been assigned to churches in Oak Park and across Chicago. He has been pastor at Mount Carmel since July 2013. Lee was removed from that post in January after someone came forward and made accusations that they were sexually abused as a child by Lee while at St. Christopher. That person has since been offered services by the Victim's Assistance Ministry of the Chicago Archdiocese. Cupich, in his statement issued by the Archdiocese on Saturday, said Lee fully cooperated with church and legal authorities, including the Cook County State's Attorney's Office and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, as they investigated the matter. The cardinal said that state officials have since found no basis for criminal charges against the priest. That led the archdiocese's Independent Review Board to decide that Lee should be reinstated as pastor at Mount Carmel. ""They found that there was insufficient reason to suspect that Father Lee had committed sexual abuse of a minor,"" Cupich wrote, adding that Lee was informed of the decision Saturday night. ""He took the occasion to reaffirm his longstanding conviction that the Church must remain vigilant in protecting our children and that we should spare no effort to bring healing to victim survivors who have been harmed,"" Cupich said in his prepared statement. When Lee was suspended, an archdiocese statement was read to the congregations of every church where Lee had worked, in an effort to keep parishioners informed. Cupich said it was just as important to clear Lee's reputation, now that charges have been dismissed. However, officials at St. Christopher said Sunday morning there were no plans to make an issue of the matter during Sunday Mass.

"Ginsburg traveled, Gorsuch wrote, Kavanaugh coached, Thomas taught: Supreme Court justices active in 2018","WASHINGTON   The nation's Supreme Court justices had a lucrative year in 2018. Chief Justice John Roberts sold as much as $250,000 in AT&T stock, gaining at least $100,000 along the way. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch reaped $225,000 in royalties for his upcoming book, ""A Republic, If You Can Keep It."" Associate Justice Clarence Thomas led his colleagues in academic income, earning $28,000 for teaching at three law schools. And new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh had the most varied resumé of the bunch. Between teaching jobs at Harvard (last year) and George Mason University (the next three years), he found time to coach his daughters' Blessed Sacrament basketball teams. 'Egregious, notorious and ongoing': Watchdog agency urges firing of Kellyanne Conway over political remarks Pelosi: Trump giving Russia 'green light' to attack U.S. elections Those were among the highlights of the justices' 2018 financial disclosure forms released Thursday. The annual listing of investments, liabilities and potential conflicts of interest showed nothing unusual for the nine members of the nation's highest court, who earn $255,300 (slightly higher for the chief justice). The forms showed that Roberts and Associate Justices Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito continued to own individual stocks last year, raising the chances that they would have to recuse themselves from cases involving those companies. Justices recused themselves from 31 cases in the 2017 term because of stock holdings, down from 47 cases in 2016. All three justices have taken steps in recent years to move much of their portfolios into mutual funds, but there was less movement in that direction last year. The public interest group Fix the Court , which advocates for increased transparency, heralded another year in which the three justices shed some stocks. They owned 40 companies at the end of 2018, down from 73 four years earlier. ""It should not take a mistake, or near-mistake, to convince a justice that he should not hold shares in a company that frequently comes before the court,"" Gabe Roth, the group's executive director, said. ""Such holdings often lead to recusals, meaning the potential for a 4-4 tie, which undermines the judiciary's ability to function properly."" Besides Gorsuch, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor also had book royalties last year. She earned $33,000 for two children's books, ""Turning Pages"" and ""The Beloved World of Sonia Sotomayor,"" an offshoot of her 2013 bestseller, ""My Beloved World."" Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Associate Justice Elena Kagan all joined Thomas in teaching law school courses for side income. But it was Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's oldest member at 86, who led her colleagues in globetrotting to speak or participate at conferences. She took 14 trips to as far as Israel, Jordan and Italy, along with Park City, Utah, for the Sundance Film Festival's premiere of the documentary about her life, ""RBG.""

White supremacist convicted of Charlottesville rally killing asked the judge to reconsider a life sentence because of his young age,"Lawyers for white supremacist Alex Fields Jr. argued in a new sentencing memo that the court should reconsider assigning a life sentence because of his age and history of mental illness. The 22-year-old previously pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes after he plowed his car into protesters opposing a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia two years ago, killing one and injuring dozens. Fields is set to be sentenced June 28, but his lawyers wrote that the ""court should find that retribution has limits"" and reconsider the life sentence prosecutors have been pushing for. The Guardian reports that the defense attorneys wrote that a sentence shorter than life would be an ""expression of mercy"" and a ""conviction that no individual is wholly defined by their worst moments."" In Friday's memo, Fields' attorneys emphasized the defendants' difficult upbringing and history of mental illness he experienced while being raised by a paraplegic single mother, according to the Associated Press . Fields' lawyers also reportedly said suffered ""trauma"" by growing up knowing that his Jewish grandfather had murdered his grandmother before committing suicide. Over the course of the trial, prosecutors reportedly focused on years of documented racist and anti-Semitic behavior by Fields, which the AP reported included emphasizing that Fields kept a picture of Adolf Hitler on his bedside table. They also reportedly said he was recorded on a jail phone call making disparaging remarks about the victim 32-year-old Heath Heyer's mother as recently as last month. Prosecutors rejected the personal appeals of the defense, saying Fields' age and past mental illness does not outweigh the charges. ""Any mental health concerns raised by the defendant do not overcome the defendant's demonstrated lack of remorse and his prior history of substantial racial animus,"" prosecutors wrote. The attorneys also wrote on Friday that Fields deserves a life sentence, adding that would help deter others from committing ""similar acts of domestic terrorism."" Fields was convicted in December of first-degree murder and other charges from a Virginia court. This is the latest development in Fields' defense, which previously saw him argue he was acting in self-defense when he hit Heyer and others with his car.",legal arguments,The Guardian,left
McConnell to meet with 9/11 first responders amid public tensions with Jon Stewart,"Sen. Mitch McConnell is scheduled to meet with 9/11 first responders this week to discuss the renewal of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act, following a public feud with comedian Jon Stewart. McConnell's office has not confirmed the meeting, but a Ground Zero recovery worker and longtime activist, John Feal, confirmed the meeting to ABC News. Feal added that he requested the meeting, which will be held Tuesday. ""I don't think he would have just openly invited me,"" he told ABC News. (MORE: Stewart fires back at McConnell for calling him 'bent out of shape' over 9/11 first responders) Earlier this month, Stewart made an emotional appeal to Congress to make the victim compensation fund permanent. With first responders and their advocates behind him, Stewart ripped Congress for failing to fully fund the program. ""They responded in five seconds, they did their jobs. With courage grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours!"" he shouted . The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which Stewart and others have battled to protect for years, is set to run out of money in December 2020. ""These cuts are real,"" Feal said Monday. ""Tomorrow will be my 270th trip to Washington in 15 years. I've got a chip on my shoulder. I'm seeing people get sick, friends die. Their families are going to be left in financial ruin."" (MORE: House Judiciary Committee moves 9/11 compensation bill to the House) Stewart has called out McConnell on several occasions for his inaction in the past regarding the bill. Stewart promised in his testimony before Congress that he and other advocates won't allow a ""certain someone"" in the Senate to use the program as a ""political football"" in spending negotiations, referring to McConnell. (MORE: An angry Jon Stewart demands Congress compensate 9/11 responders) McConnell retaliated on ""Fox and Friends"" saying he didn't know why Stewart was ""bent out of shape,"" and denied that he was moving slowly on the issue. He also said the extension would pass when it came up for renewal. Stewart fired back on the ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" arguing that he was ""not bent out of shape."" He said he was upset that heroes were getting sick or dying and desperately needed Congress' help. ""These are the first heroes and veterans and victims of the great trillions of dollars War on Terror. And they are currently dying, suffering and in terrible need,"" he said. ""You know you would think that would be enough for Congress to pay attention, but apparently, it's not."" ABC News' Aaron Katersky contributed to this report.",politics,ABC News,left

disgraced theranos founder elizabeth holmes criminal trial set for summer 2020,"SAN JOSE (CBS SF)   A federal judge ordered Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes to stand trial in the summer of 2020 on fraud charges which could earn her up to to 20 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines. U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davila said Friday that the much anticipated Holmes trial will begin on July 28, 2020 with attorneys expected to begin presenting evidence on Aug. 4, 2020. Holmes has been charged with felony conspiracy and fraud for allegedly misleading investors, corporate partners and patients with claims about her allegedly revolutionary blood testing equipment. A grand jury indicted she and her former boyfriend and Theranos president Sunny Balwani on 11 criminal counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The pair also could face fines totaling $2.75 million each. The 35-year-old Holmes dropped out of Stanford to found Theranos in 2003 and soon became the darling of Silicon Valley accumulating a personal wealth once estimated in the billions. Theranos was a private health care and life sciences company with the stated mission to revolutionize medical laboratory testing through allegedly innovative methods for drawing blood, testing blood and interpreting the resulting patient data. Holmes and Balwani signed up both Safeway and Walgreens into agreements to use Theranos testing equipment inside clinics within their stores. Balwani, 53, of Atherton, was employed at Theranos from September of 2009 through 2016. At times during that period, Balwani worked in several capacities including as a member of the company's board of directors, as its president, and as its chief operating officer. According to the indictment, Holmes and Balwani used advertisements and solicitations to encourage and induce doctors and patients to use Theranos's blood testing laboratory services, even though the defendants knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests. The tests performed on Theranos technology, in addition, were likely to contain inaccurate and unreliable results. The indictment alleges that the defendants used a combination of direct communications, marketing materials, statements to the media, financial statements, models, and other information to defraud potential investors. Specifically, the defendants claimed that Theranos developed a revolutionary and proprietary analyzer that the defendants referred to by various names, including as the TSPU, Edison, or minilab. The defendants claimed the analyzer was able to perform a full range of clinical tests using small blood samples drawn from a finger stick. The defendants also represented that the analyzer could produce results that were more accurate and reliable than those yielded by conventional methods all at a faster speed than previously possible. The indictment further alleges that Holmes and Balwani knew that many of their representations about the analyzer were false. The defendants allegedly represented to investors that Theranos had a profitable and revenue-generating business relationship with the United States Department of Defense and that Theranos's technology had deployed to the battlefield   a claim that was false. The Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil fraud charges against Holmes and Balwani. Holmes settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $500,000 in fines and penalties. Balwani, 53, is fighting the charges. © Copyright 2019 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Associated Press contributed to this report",crime,AP,center
Naomi Wolf faces 'new questions' as US publisher postpones latest book,"Naomi Wolf's US publisher has postponed the release of her new book and is recalling copies from booksellers, saying that new questions have arisen over the book's content. Outrages, which argues that the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 led to a turn against consensual sex between men and an increase in executions for sodomy, was published in the UK on 20 May. Wolf has already acknowledged that the book contains two errors , after an on-air challenge on BBC Radio 3 during which the writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet told her that she had misunderstood the term ""death recorded"" in historical records as signifying an execution. In fact it denotes the opposite, Sweet pointed out, highlighting that a teenager she said had been ""actually executed for sodomy"" in 1859 was paroled two years after being convicted. Wolf said last month that she had thanked Sweet for highlighting the mistakes, and was correcting future editions. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt initially stood by plans to publish the book on 18 June in the US, describing the mistake over the executions as an unfortunate error, and declaring: ""We believe the overall thesis of the book Outrages still holds."" But the publisher told the New York Times on Thursday that the book will be delayed. ""As we have been working with Naomi Wolf to make corrections to Outrages, new questions have arisen that require more time to explore,"" it said in a statement. ""We are postponing publication and requesting that all copies be returned from retail accounts while we work to resolve those questions."" Wolf said on Friday morning that she strongly objected to the decision to postpone and recall, and that she would ""do all I can to bring Outrages to American readers"". She said she had made necessary changes immediately following her BBC interview, adding that critics had ""also introduced errors of their own"". The heart of her book, she said, was ""not criminology … but censorship"", and ""the chill felt by pioneers such as John Addington Symonds who tried to speak out about love"". Wolf's UK publisher Virago confirmed on Friday that their edition would remain on sale. ""Though the book received excellent reviews it also attracted criticism,"" it said, adding that any necessary corrections would be made to future reprints.",legal arguments,The New York Times,left
"alabama woman charged in fetal death, her shooter goes free","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP)   An Alabama prosecutor's office hasn't decided whether to prosecute a woman who lost her fetus after she was shot in the stomach and was subsequently indicted on manslaughter charges. Marshae Jones was five months pregnant when 23-year-old Ebony Jemison shot her in the stomach during a December altercation regarding the fetus's father, authorities said. Jemison was initially charged with manslaughter, but a Jefferson County grand jury declined to indict her after police said an investigation determined Jones started the fight, and Jemison ultimately fired in self-defense. Jones, 28, was indicted by that same grand jury Wednesday. The indictment stated Jones did ""intentionally cause the death"" of ""Unborn Baby Jones by initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant."" However, the office of District Attorney Lynneice O. Washington said there has been no decision on whether to pursue the case against Jones. Washington's office said in a statement they ""feel sympathy for all the families involved, including Mrs. Jones, who lost her unborn child."" While the grand jury ""had its say,"" the statement said, the office has ""not yet made a determination about whether to prosecute it as a manslaughter case, reduce it to a lesser charge or not to prosecute it."" ""Foremost, it should be stated that this is a truly tragic case, resulting in the death of an unborn child,"" the prosecutor's office said. ""The fact that this tragedy was 100 percent avoidable makes this case even more disheartening."" After the shooting, Pleasant Grove police Lt. Danny Reid had called the fetus ""the only true victim."" who was unnecessarily brought into a fight and was ""dependent on its mother to try to keep it from harm."" Advocates for women's rights expressed outrage over Jones' arrest. Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, said women across the country have been prosecuted for manslaughter or murder for having an abortion or experiencing a miscarriage. She said Alabama currently leads the nation in charging women for crimes related to their pregnancies. She said hundreds have been prosecuted for running afoul of the state's ""chemical endangerment of a child"" statute by exposing their embryo or fetus to controlled substances. But this is the first time she's heard of a pregnant woman being charged after getting shot. ""This takes us to a new level of inhumanity and illegality towards pregnant women,"" Paltrow said. ""I can't think of any other circumstance where a person who themselves is a victim of a crime is treated as the criminal."" The district attorney's office said it will decide how to proceed ""only after all due diligence has been performed."" Alabama is one of dozens of states that have fetal homicide laws allowing criminal charges when fetuses are killed in violent acts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Jones' arrest also drew criticism from the Yellowhammer Fund, which raises money to help women have access to abortions. ""The state of Alabama has proven yet again that the moment a person becomes pregnant their sole responsibility is to produce a live, healthy baby and that it considers any action a pregnant person takes that might impede in that live birth to be a criminal act,"" said Amanda Reyes, the group's director. ___ Associated Press reporters Jeff Martin in Atlanta and Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed to this report.",environmental issues,San Francisco Chronicle,left
Microsoft is cashing in on the biggest biotech IPO of 2019,"Microsoft's $45 million investment in Adaptive has almost quadrupled in value following the company's market debut on Thursday. The two companies are working together to create a single blood test that can diagnose many diseases. Adaptive faces competition from companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline. In late 2017, Microsoft invested in an experimental health-care company called Adaptive Biotechnologies , hoping to put its advanced cloud technology to work in life sciences while also making money as a significant shareholder. As of Thursday, Microsoft appears poised to do both. Adaptive, which is developing what it calls an ""immune medicine platform"" to change how we treat various diseases, soared in its public market debut, more than doubling to over $40 after the company sold shares Wednesday night at $20 a piece. The pop means the value of Microsoft's $45 million investment at $10.67 a share has almost quadrupled. As the world's most valuable public company, with a market cap over $1 trillion, Microsoft has many ways to generate profits. Start-up investments represent one avenue, though the software maker has been far less active than many other large tech companies like Alphabet, which has multiple venture groups for early and late-stage deals , and Salesforce, which has been a big investor in cloud software and recently launched specific funds in in Canada , Japan and Australia . With Adaptive, there's much more at stake for Microsoft than just an investment in the biggest biotech IPO of 2019 so far. Microsoft's Azure unit, which is second in the cloud infrastructure market behind Amazon Web Services, gets to test out its artificial intelligence tools in an industry that promises to be highly lucrative in the coming years as more emerging health-related companies turn to software in the cloud for heavy workloads. According to Orbis Research , the global immunology market will grow to $74.1 billion in 2022 from $57.7 billion in 2015. Adaptive has agreed to spend a minimum of $12 million on Azure over seven years, according to its IPO prospectus , and Microsoft is the exclusive provider of cloud services during that period. ""We believe deeply in the potential for this partnership with Adaptive and have made a substantial financial investment in the company,"" Peter Lee, Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI and research, wrote in a blog post when the agreement was announced. ""We have also begun a major research and development collaboration that involves Adaptive's scientists working closely with our top researchers to use Adaptive's innovative sequencing technology and Microsoft's large-scale machine learning and cloud computing capabilities to make deep reading of the immune system a reality."" Competition in health Adaptive mentions Microsoft 74 times in its prospectus. Ultimately, the two companies aim to develop a single blood test for early detection of many diseases, including cancers and autoimmune disorders. Adaptive's competitors include Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Qiagen and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Chief Technical Officer Sean Nolan previously worked at Microsoft, where he led the HealthVault team that focused on software for storing people's health data. Microsoft's investment in Adaptive came months after it identified health care as a focal point . In April, the company hired Gregory Moore as corporate vice president of health technology and alliances. Moore was previously running Google's cloud health-care efforts and before that worked at the health system Geisinger. AWS is also making a push in the market, offering tools for genomics research as well as biotech companies, health-care providers and insurers. Brothers Chad and Harlan Robins founded Seattle-based Adaptive in 2009. The company had 346 employees at the end of March. Adaptive raised $300 million in the IPO, topping the amount brought in by Cortexyme, Personalis, Prevail Therapeutics and other biotech companies that have debuted this year. Microsoft has had other investment wins. The company inherited a stake in software start-up Confluent through its $27 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, and the value of that investment has since increased dramatically . And earlier this week Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said that buying part of Facebook before the social media company went public was ""a super-successful investment.""

livestream: democrats square off in first presidential debate,"MIAMI, FL   This week's two-night political spectacle in Miami starting Wednesday is shaping up to look more like a football game than a Democratic presidential debate. A total of 20 presidential candidates will take the stage at Miami's Adriene Arsht Center over two nights   10 candidates on Wednesday and 10 on Thursday. The debate will air at 9 p.m. ET on June 26 and 27 on NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo. It will be streamed online for free on a variety of digital and social platforms. Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie, Jose Diaz-Balart, Rachel Maddow and Chuck Todd will be the NBC News personalities onstage in Miami. NBC has been skittish about revealing too much in advance. The network wouldn't talk about topics on the agenda   that's typical   and until Tuesday, kept under wraps details about how it would run. With less than 48 hours' notice, NBC announced the candidates would have 60 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds for follow-ups. The candidates will be allowed closing statements but no openers. Rashida Jones, the NBC news executive behind this inaugural Democratic presidential debate, will have to juggle all 20 candidates, five news personalities and quite possibly one tweeting president. Watch the 2020 Democratic presidential debate live on ""PBS NewsHour."" Patch will update this article with a livestream if one becomes available. ""Primary debates are a big prestige event for every network,"" said Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of Hofstra University's school of communication, who had Jones' job four years ago. ""It's why every network tries to get one and tries to get as many as they can. It's a branding opportunity."" The American voting public will have four hours to get to know the candidates and to decide who will get their donations. ""It's a sound bite competition,"" Lukasiewicz said. NBC's decision to include five of its own people also crowds the stage. They won't be on at the same time: The teams of Guthrie and Diaz-Balart, and Todd and Maddow, will moderate an hour each night, with Holt and Guthrie a constant presence. Some debate experts wonder if this will hurt the event's flow and cost opportunities for conversational follow-ups. The following candidates have been invited to participate in the Miami debate: Sen. Michael Bennet (Born in New Delhi, India; U.S. Sen. from Colorado) Former Vice President Joe Biden* (Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania; Served as U.S. Senator from Delaware) Sen.

How to set up Siri to read your text messages through your AirPods in iOS 13,"Apple's iOS 13 update will be available this fall. In it, you can set Siri to read your text messages through AirPods. Here's how to set Siri up to read you your text messages, which you'll be able to also try in the iOS 13 public preview, which is coming soon. Apple's new iOS 13 update , which will roll out to iPhones this fall, lets you set up Siri to automatically read your your text messages through your AirPods. That means you don't have to pull out your phone to check your messages while you're walking around a city during your morning commute. You can also respond to the text messages using your voice, and Siri will send them off for you. This is a feature that will roll out in iOS 13 this fall, but I've been using the developer beta so I can show you how it works. And you'll be able to try it for yourself soon. Apple plans to release its public preview of iOS 13 soon, it recently said sometime in July, so bookmark this page so you can follow the steps when it's available. Here's what you need to do. How to set up Siri to read your text messages through your AirPods Open the Settings menu on your iPhone. Tap Notifications (it's weird Apple didn't put this under Siri and Search, but maybe that will change.) Tap ""Announce Messages with Siri."" Toggle the ""Announce Messages with Siri"" to on. There's also an option to ""Send replies without confirmation,"" which means you can speak a text message back to someone and Siri won't read it back to you before sending it. I like leaving this off, just to make sure Siri gets everything right. Finally, tap the ""Messages"" button at the bottom of the page. Choose who you want to receive messages from, whether it's just favorites, recent contacts, all contacts or everyone who sends you a message. That's it. Now, when your phone receives a text message, Siri will speak the contents of that message into your AirPods. It seems like Siri should be able to do the same for notifications from other apps in the future, but right now it's purely limited to Messages. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",science,CNBC,center
Middle school educator dies while rock climbing in Yosemite,"A California middle school special education paraprofessional died this month while climbing in Yosemite National Park, authorities said. Originally from Detroit, Patricia ""Trish"" Stoops, 57, died June 8 in a rappelling accident at the Central Pillar of Frenzy, one of the popular rock-climbing lines at Yosemite on the north face of the Middle Cathedral Rock. ""She had taken the lead to get the team down before dark and something, what exactly still isn't clear, went horribly wrong,"" her brother Michael Stoops wrote on a climbing forum. ""She did not survive the fall, unfortunately. No one else was injured."" A former architect who left a lucrative career in Manhattan Beach, Stoops worked at Glick Middle School in Modesto where she and Jamey Johnson-Olney, an English language development teacher, founded the HOPE Project, an extracurricular program that organizes service trips for students. In February, Stoops and Johnson-Olney took a group of students to Paradise, Calif., to help a father and daughter who had lost their home in the Camp fire . ""Trish lived a bohemian lifestyle. She had her biological family, her climber family, her school family   the world was her family,"" Johnson-Olney said. ""Some people collect cards, some collect stamps. Trish collected people. She had a gift of bringing people from all walks of life together."" Johnson-Olney said many students at Glick come from neighborhoods ""where gang violence, drugs and instability are commonplace."" The mission behind the HOPE Project is to offer those students a chance to see the world beyond their neighborhoods. Johnson-Olney and her students are planning to build a house in Mexico for families in need   a trip she and Stoops had been planning for months. ""Our students and I are determined to honor her life and legacy by continuing to do the work she left here,"" Johnson-Olney said.

how 9-year-old riley morrison created real change at under armour,"Every day in June, FN is showcasing female leaders across the industry for our Women in Power series. After hanging out with NBA star Stephen Curry in March at the player's SC30 pop-up shop in Oakland, Calif., 9-year-old California native Riley Morrison has become a local celebrity. ""People at my school asked for autographs, and some people didn't believe that it really happened,"" Morrison told FN. ""Random people in Napa have recognized me, said hello and asked for photos."" The young athlete   who plays softball, soccer and basketball in local leagues   got to see the warmer side of the three-time champion firsthand. ""I was nervous at first waiting for him by myself, but he made me laugh, and we had a lot of fun telling jokes,"" Morrison said. ""I told him, 'Have you heard about the Spanish magician? He said, on the count of three, I will disappear   uno, dos and disappeared without a tres.'"" But it was a more serious topic that afforded Morrison the opportunity to meet Curry. In November, she sent a letter to the Golden State Warriors guard   which was shared on social media by her father, Chris, an admitted sneakerhead   saying it was unfair that his Under Armour Curry 5 sneakers weren't available in sizing for girls. Because of her letter, Morrison was asked to help design the ""United We Win"" colorway of the Curry 6, which hit stores in March. But her impact will be felt beyond the release of one shoe.""As Riley put it, 'Girls want to rock Currys too,' so we're ensuring that boys and girls have access to styles they want,"" Under Armour's SVP of global brand, Attica Jacques, told FN. ""At a macro level, Riley was a wake-up call to ensure that we are addressing the needs of young women and girls at every turn."" Jacques continued, ""Riley Morrison alerted us to a problem we had on our own e-commerce site. We're ensuring that a broader variety of youth styles are available within both the boys' and girls' sections, letting our youngest consumers decide what they want before drawing those conclusions ourselves."" Specifically concerning the Curry franchise, sneakers now will be offered in sizing for women   including the Curry 7, which will hit stores before year's end. ""A 9-year-old saying, 'This isn't fair, it isn't right,' proves that it doesn't matter your age or your gender, if you say something in a nice way and if you're positive, change can happen very quickly,"" Morrison's mom, Megan Lopez, said. Although she has accomplished one major feat at a young age, her female empowerment mission is far from complete. Morrison, who one day wants to play in the WNBA, already has her next goal lined up: getting more girls to participate in sports. ""[Sports] is something I love. I love to be with my teammates and to create a bond with them on the field or on the court or whether it's out somewhere else,"" Morrison said.

Get Ready for 'Gracepoint': A UK Whodunit Redone,"Let's face it: The Brits are really good   perhaps too good   at TV crime drama. Especially the dark and grisly whodunits, where anyone and everyone   often in a community where everyone knows each other   quickly becomes a suspect in the crime. Where suddenly one of the neighbors might just be a murderer. Broadchurch , which aired in the U.K. last year, is a first-rate example. The highly acclaimed crime drama, starring David Tennant (of Dr. Who fame), is about the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a close-knit seaside town. And it's a masterful piece of TV. With a character-driven script, compelling cinematography and an award-winning score , the show was a huge hit with blockbuster ratings. Which is probably why the people at Fox snapped up the show to remake it for a U.S. audience. A deliciously, nail-bitingly suspenseful story… Get ready for Gracepoint . Set in a coastal town in northern California (but actually filmed further north in British Columbia), the plot is similar: A young boy from a small community is found dead on the beach. One by one, members of the town become the focus of the investigation, helmed by lead detective Emmett Carver, an outsider brought in to investigate, and the slightly disgruntled hometown detective, Ellie Miller, who was passed over for the top job. At its core, it's a story of a tragedy, and a town that must somehow come to grips with that tragedy. It's not clear yet just how faithful Gracepoint   billed by the network as a ""10-Part Mystery Event""   will be to its acclaimed predecessor, although the trailer definitely has a familiar feel . The show's official site promises some new characters and additional suspects and plot twists   which might be worrisome, considering how deliciously, nail-bitingly suspenseful the original story unfolds. Tennant even recently teased that ""the ending is going to be different."" The biggest casting surprise: David Tennant. Not only does he reprise the top-cop role, but he also swaps his Scottish accent for a Californian one. The delightful Anna Gunn of Breaking Bad plays Carver's sidekick: the likable, earnest hometown detective   who also happens to be the best friend of grieving mother Beth, played by Virginia Kull (The Following, Boardwalk Empire). Jacki Weaver and Nick Nolte also make appearances. For fans of Broadchurch , which aired on BBC America last summer, the promise of a different ending makes the wait until the fall 2014 season that much more unbearable. Successful American TV series based on British TV series: All in the Family House of Cards Life on Mars The Office Shameless Sherlock Three's Company So how good is Tennant's Californian accent? Apparently "" fantastic ,"" according to show creator Chris Chibnal. ( Watch this compilation and decide for yourself.) Tennant follows many Brit actors who have played thoroughly convincing Americans: Andrew Lincoln and David Morrissey ( The Walking Dead ), Hugh Laurie ( House ), Charlie Hunnam ( Sons of Anarchy ), Matthew Rhys ( The Americans ), Alan Cumming ( The Good Wife ). But if Fox pulls this off and successfully re-creates one of the best U.K. whodunits in recent memory, viewers won't be paying attention to Tennant's Golden State nuances. No, we'll be riveted to the screen, watching transfixed as devastated town residents unravel, turning against each other. Waiting to find out who really killed Danny Lasseter.

How the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier lives on in other US Navy flattops,"Parts from the USS Enterprise   the ""Big E""   are being incorporated into other US Navy carriers. See where the pieces of this big ship are going. The USS Enterprise, the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, may be out of action, but it lives on in other active US Navy aircraft carriers, according to Defense One. Parts from the ""Big E"" are being harvested and have so far been incorporated into the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS George Washington. After 51 years of service, the Enterprise is sitting lifeless at a shipyard in Virginia, where it waits for a decision by the Navy on exactly what to do with the decommissioned flattop. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories . The first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier - the USS Enterprise - is being harvested for parts for other US Navy flattops. The Enterprise waged war from Vietnam to Afghanistan during its 51 years of service. Decommissioned a little over two years ago, the ""Big E"" rests at the James River shipyard at Newport News in Virginia, where it waits on the Navy to figure out what to do with the enormous one-of-a-kind ship. Read more: The US Navy is pouring millions of dollars into this nuclear-powered aircraft carrier it can't figure out how to scrap But while CVN 65 is no longer taking the fight to the enemy on the high seas, it will live on in its successors. ""We are harvesting as many parts as we can from the Enterprise,"" Chris Miner, vice president of in-service carriers at Newport News, told Defense One's Marcus Weisgerber and Brad Peniston during a visit to Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding. ""She's still giving back even today."" Parts from the Enterprise are being incorporated into existing Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. Pieces of the retired Navy vessel will also be added to future Ford-class carriers, including one that bears the same name. The USS Abraham Lincoln was a recipient of one of the Enterprise's anchors. Source: Defense One The anchor for a Nimitz-class carrier weighs 60,000 pounds. The chains add another 20,500 pounds. Source: The Drive The USS George Washington, along with the Lincoln, received components of the Enterprise's aircraft-launching catapults. Source: Defense One US Navy aircraft carriers rely on steam or electromagnetic catapults to launch aircraft. The launch system is more effective and efficient than the ski jumps seen on Russian and Chinese carriers. The Navy has taken possession of the Enterprise's four 32-ton propellers. It is unclear at this time what the Navy intends to do with them. Source: The Drive Part of the decommissioned USS Enterprise's steel hull has been taken out and melted to become part of the keel, a structural backbone for the ship, for the future USS Enterprise (CVN 80), one of the Navy's elite new Ford-class supercarriers. Source: Defense One There is also the possibility that parts of the nuclear-reactor plant can be used on other carriers, despite the plant being quite different from more modern carriers, having eight small reactors rather than the two larger ones seen on Nimitz and Ford-class carriers.",science,INSIDER,center
Dallas shooting: Newspaper photographer came face to face with the active shooter,"It was a normal Monday morning for Dallas newspaper photographer Tom Fox, until it wasn't. The Dallas Morning News staff photographer had just arrived at the Earle Cabell Federal Building to cover a trial when he saw the gunman. He was dressed in a black mask and black tactical gear, running toward the courthouse carrying a large rifle and multiple magazines of ammo strapped to his waist. ""I just kept thinking, 'He's going to look at me around that corner and he's going to shoot,'"" Fox told the paper . The gunman soon began firing , shattering glass and sending people in the building diving for cover. His targets: Fox himself, a security guard, a woman walking a golden retriever and a man who hadn't tied his tie yet, Fox told his newspaper . At some point Fox shot, too. And his photo, tweeted by the newspaper Monday morning, is shocking. The shooter, later identified by officials as 22-year old Brian Isaack Clyde, appears panicked, peering out behind wide-framed glasses over the mask that covers his nose and mouth. He appears to be loading a magazine into the gun, and in motion. Fox, who took the photograph while hiding behind a column just steps from the gunman, wasn't sure if he would be shot. ""I just stood there and prayed that he wouldn't walk past me,"" Fox told the Dallas Morning News . ""Because if he walks past me and sees me, he's going to shoot me. He's already got the gun out. ""I was just praying, 'please don't pass me, please don't pass me.'"" Bullets ricocheted off the wall above him. ""I saw the puff of smoke, but I didn't know at the time whether that was him or the police firing,"" Fox said. ""I'll never forget the sound of those repeated firing and all that glass shattering. It seemed like forever before I heard return gunfire."" Not long after Fox captured the stunning moment, officials engaged gunfire with the shooter, FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno said. Clyde was shot and taken to an area hospital, where he died. ""At this time, we have no information indicating that there are other shooters, other threats to the community,"" DeSarno said. No officers or other citizens were injured. The photographer told his paper he was questioned by the FBI. But he's got questions of his own, too. ""He was just so young. All I could think was 'why?' There's just too many questions I haven't processed yet,"" Fox told the Morning News . ""But this young man, what was it all for? Was it really worth it   for this?"" On his website , Fox says he's been a photojournalist for nearly 25 years. In 2006 he and his team won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography for their coverage of Hurricane Katrina. ""Every day is different, bringing with it new possibilities and an opportunity for creativity,"" he writes.",crime,The Dallas Morning News,center
US resident freed by Iran to Trump: 'Get back your hostages',"BEIRUT   A Lebanese man and permanent U.S. resident who was released after spending years in an Iranian prison called on President Donald Trump and Western countries to ""please get back your hostages from Iran,"" adding that he saw American detainees during his nearly four-year imprisonment. In an interview with The Associated Press, Nizar Zakka said he was subjected to ""all kinds of torture,"" both physical and mental, during his detention in the notorious Evin prison in Tehran, including standing on one leg for hours, extended periods of interrogation and lack of food. ""Nobody on earth deserves such suffering,"" he said in the 30-minute emotional interview during which he broke down in tears at one point. Zakka, an information technology expert, was arrested in Iran in September 2015 while trying to fly out of Tehran. He had just attended a conference there at the invitation of one of the country's vice presidents. The following year, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison after authorities accused him of being an American spy   allegations he and his associates vigorously reject. He was released Tuesday and flew back to his native Lebanon, amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Last year, the Trump administration decided to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal, and re-impose heavy sanctions on Iran. The past weeks have witnessed a flurry of diplomatic activity to ease tensions and salvage the landmark deal. Zakka is one of several prisoners with either dual nationality or links to the West held in the Islamic Republic's prisons. It was not clear why Iran decided to act now, after years of Lebanese officials asking for his release. ""In my opinion, it was a good timing for the Iranians, and especially they had a request from the President of the Lebanese Republic,"" Zakka said. ""They took this opportunity to send also a message ... de-escalating tensions within the region."" Zakka told the AP that during his detention he met several Westerners held in Iran, and for two years shared a cell with Chinese-American Xiyue Wang, a Princeton University graduate student sentenced to 10 years behind bars after being accused of ""infiltrating"" the country and sending confidential material abroad. ""I really ask President Trump to not leave Xiyue behind and other Americans behind, please,"" he said.",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
Pennsylvania woman bitten by venomous copperhead snake while doing laundry,"A Pennsylvania woman was taken to the hospital after she was bitten by a venomous copperhead snake when she went to her basement to do laundry.

The snake that bit her was on a shelf in the basement, police said. Giant snakes in the Florida Everglades: How scientists are using Burmese pythons as spies The Reading Eagle in Pennsylvania reported the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission arrived on scene, identified the snake as a copperhead and then bagged it and transported it ""to a safer location.""

A dad sent up his drone to get photos of his kids at the beach in Florida. Then things got scary,"A Florida man got a scare when he decided to use his drone to get a few photos of his kids at the beach.

Watson shared the images on his Instagram page. One of the images shows the shark swimming close to a group of people. The other shows the group running for the shore with the shark swimming away.

""That was my view this weekend while flying my Mavic 2 Pro… and oh, 3 of those people are my kids!""

""It was a God moment, because he was just going to fly the drone for fun, and it was just for a fun picture,"" she told the TV station. ""But to see that my children were in knee-deep water and you see this big shark approaching them, it's humbling to know that, and I'm thankful he put that drone up at that moment."" Watson told BuzzFeed News he saw the shark ""within 30 seconds"" of getting his drone in the air. ""It makes me a little wary of the water for now,"" he said.

"Earthquakes ravaged Los Angeles and San Francisco. So, what spared this city in the California desert?","RIDGECREST, Calif.   After powerful back-to-back magnitude 6.4 and 7.1 earthquakes struck this city, the management of Kristy's Family Restaurant summed up the damage: a tub of butter fell on the floor. That was it. ""I'm surprised nothing happened,"" said the diner's owner, Hani Kamani, over the din of a busy Sunday breakfast crowd. This desert city of about 27,000 appeared to have escaped the quakes largely unscathed when it comes to structural damage, city officials said. There were no deaths or major injuries reported and only four building fires, likely sparked by ruptured natural gas or electrical lines. Stores were cluttered with fallen items on the floors. But many, even a Walmart that earlier news reports said had been hit hard, called in overnight cleanup crews that allowed them to quickly reopen. At the Eastridge Market, the mini-mart was doing a brisk business despite aisles awash in a sticky stew of liquor and broken glass from a cascade of bottles that the quake sent cascading to the floor. By contrast, the San Francisco Bay and greater Los Angeles areas have experienced significant damage following quakes over the past century of lesser intensity. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a 6.9-magnitude temblor, killed 63 and caused buildings and freeways to collapse in San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding areas. The 6.7-magnitude 1994 shaker in Northridge, a Los Angeles suburb, is blamed for at least 57 deaths and $25 billion in damage, including many collapsed structures or buildings knocked off their foundations. 'Scared to death': 7.1 earthquake follows 6.4, leaving Ridgecrest residents fearful, resilient So, why not Ridgecrest? Sure, a more detailed damage assessment was ongoing in the city about 170 miles north of Los Angeles. And Trona, a tiny factory town about 30 miles to the east Ridgecrest with many older buildings, took a harder hit. But to some, Ridgecrest's seemingly lucky break was viewed with a nod to divine intervention   ""a blessing and a miracle,"" said Dionsio Mitchell, a battalion chief for the Kern County Fire Department, which protects the city. Mayor Peggy Breeden, who has lived in Ridgecrest since 1983, takes a more pragmatic view. She points out that most of the buildings in the city were constructed from the 1970s onward, when the state and architects alike became more aware of earthquake safety and incorporated into law, design and materials. Just as significantly, Breeden said it's common for contractors to encounter caliche , a layer of calcium carbonate-bound rock that is especially difficult to break apart. Building on rock, not sand, can make a big difference when it comes to building safety, experts say. The degree of damage ""depends not only how big the earthquake is, but rock or soil. In Los Angeles, we expect stronger shaking because it is soft sediment,"" said Lingsen Meng, an associate professor of geophysics at UCLA. ""If you were standing on bedrock ... the shaking will be reduced."" 'I hope this is not the end': Trona, California, was trying to bounce back. Then an earthquake hit. Then a bigger one. And John Ebel, a professor in the earth and environmental sciences department at Boston College, added that parts of Los Angeles are built on soft soil from ancient riverbed, making them more susceptible to shaking. As for Ridgecrest, Ebel, who just authored a book on earthquakes in New England , said: ""I am not surprised the town did so well,"" crediting stronger, modern building codes. ""Any building that was about 20 years old should have done pretty well in the earthquake"" if built to code. Ridgecrest officials have been searching for answers to the town's good fortune, without success. ""We've asked other experts the same thing...and they are like, ""Uh, someone is looking over you guys because we don't know, either,'"" said Police Chief Jed McLaughlin.

ADM ships Brazil corn to Smithfield Foods in the United States amid heavy rains,"By Ana Mano and Roberto Samora SAO PAULO, June 4 (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co and other grain traders are selling Brazilian corn to Smithfield Foods Inc in the United States, where wet weather has reduced plantings, said two sources with knowledge of the matter. The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive market information, said Smithfield owns port facilities on the U.S. east coast and sometimes buys corn abroad because of the cost of shipping grains from the domestic corn belt. ""We are just finding a destination for Brazil corn and supplying those who know there will be a shortage ... Just being faster and nothing else,"" said a third source close to ADM. ADM declined to comment. Smithfield, a subsidiary of China's WH Group, did not return a request for comment. The sources did not give the names of other traders shipping Brazilian corn. One source said Smithfield Foods likely ordered between five and 10 corn shipments from Brazil, which are expected to be loaded onto ships between September and January. The other source said Paraguay and Argentina are also shipping corn to the United States, with around 1 million tonnes now under contract for shipment from South America to the United States. A record delay in corn planting in the United States, the world's largest producer and exporter, is likely to drive demand for Brazilian corn this season as U.S. farmers struggle with heavy rains, according to analysts and market data. Only 67% of U.S. corn was planted by June 2, well behind the five-year average of 96%, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Brazil's government forecast corn exports would grow by 25% this season, to 31 million tonnes, even before the weather-related issues affected U.S. corn plantings. The last time Brazil sold significant amounts of corn to the United States was during a drought in 2012 and 2013. Brazilian corn exports to the United States at the time totaled 1.7 million tonnes, according to government data. Increasing Brazilian exports will also be key to reducing carry over stocks of around 16.5 million tonnes, analysts said, referencing the government's latest grain report in May. ""We started the season with the need to export at least 30 million tonnes,"" said Daniely Santos, grains market analyst at Céleres consultancy. With the prospect of a record crop of around 100 million tonnes of corn this season, Brazil will need to export even more to lower domestic supplies, she said. Brazil has started harvesting its second corn crop, which is planted after the soybean harvest, and farmers are reaping the benefits of favorable prices. Heavy rain in the United States helped lift prices in Chicago by about 15% in May.

New rally called while Phoenix police chief promises change,"PHOENIX (AP)   Police Chief Jeri Williams promised change in her department after being booed by some of hundreds of people gathered to discuss a videotaped police encounter that has caused a national outcry. The meeting at a downtown church Tuesday night was called by the city after the release of a bystander's video of officers who pointed their guns and shouted obscenities last month at a black family. Dravon Ames and his pregnant fiancee Iesha Harper, who was holding their 1-year-old daughter, say their 4-year-old daughter took a doll from a store without their knowledge. ""Real change starts with the community,"" Williams said to a sometimes hostile crowd comprised mainly of blacks and Hispanics. ""Real change starts with the firing of the officers! Fire them!"" one woman shouted toward the stage, where Williams, who is herself black, was seated next to Mayor Kate Gallego and other Phoenix city leaders. Williams assured those gathered that the meeting would not be the last. ""We are here to listen, we are here to make change,"" she said. The couple wants the officers to be fired. Local advocacy groups have called a rally outside City Hall on Wednesday afternoon, following by a march to a regular City Council meeting to call for police department reforms. Ames addressed the crowd briefly, drawing applause when he said he and his family were lucky to be alive after the incident. ""No one should ever try to justify what happened that day,"" he said. ""We matter,"" said Harper. Others who spoke included the father of Jacob Harris, a black 19-year-old man who was shot and killed by a Phoenix officer in January following an armed robbery. Earlier Tuesday, Phoenix police released surveillance video aimed at backing up their assertion that adults and not just a child were shoplifting before the incident. The heavily edited store video shows a man taking something from a display rack and examining it, but it's unclear what happened to the package when he walked off camera. Another snippet of video shows a little girl with a doll in a box walking out of the store accompanied by adults. A police statement last week about the incident in late May states Ames told police he threw a pair of stolen underwear out of his car. Police also say a woman traveling in a different vehicle was arrested separately for stealing aluminum foil. The store decided not to prosecute and no charges have been filed. The couple filed a $10 million claim against the city alleging civil rights violations. The race of the officers is not known. Ames has a pending case on charges of aggravated assault of a police officer in an unrelated case that followed a traffic accident in suburban Tempe, Arizona, last year. Court documents say Ames unsuccessfully tried to kick officers several times when they arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence of marijuana. One Tempe officer used a stun gun on Ames because he thought he was trying to grab the other officer's gun, according to documents. Phoenix police have not responded to repeated questions about whether the officers in the videotaped encounter following the alleged shoplifting were aware of, or influenced by, Ames' earlier case. Civil liberties attorney Sandra Slaton has called the prior case irrelevant. The police chief has said an investigation into the officers' actions is under way.",politics,AP News,center
University of Utah student Mackenzie Lueck took a Lyft to meet someone at a park. Now she's missing,"AP Domestic Police: search continues for missing Utah student Police in Salt Lake City say there still is no sign of missing University of Utah senior Mackenzie Lueck since she was dropped off by a Lyft driver early June 17. A police official says the investigation into her disappearance continues. (June 24) Salt Lake City police are searching for a University of Utah senior who has been missing for a week, though at this point, they do not suspect foul play. Mackenzie Lueck, 23, landed at Salt Lake City International Airport early on June 17 after visiting family in California. She took a Lyft to Hatch Park in North Salt Lake and met up with another person in a car, police said. That, according to police, was the last time Lueck was seen. Salt Lake City Police Department Detective Greg Wilking told USA TODAY that law enforcement believes that meeting was ""cordial."" ""It seemed like she was a willing a participant in meeting up with this person,"" Wilking said. ""We don't have any reason to believe there's foul play."" Since Lueck has been missing, Wilking said she's missed a flight back to California for a wedding. He added that the department's level of concern rises with each day it doesn't hear from Lueck. Police have opened a tip line for the case. ""We are actively following up on any leads that come in and actively searching for her,"" Wilking said. Lyft said the route that Lueck's driver took contained no irregularities and ended at the destination as originally entered by the rider. The driver continued providing rides immediately after Lueck's ride, Lyft said. ""We recognize how scary this must be for those who know and love Ms. Lueck,"" a Lyft spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY. ""The safety of our community is fundamental to Lyft and we are actively assisting law enforcement with their investigation."" Wilking said that in the past, there have been cases where people have gone ""off the grid"" and don't want to be contacted by family. If that's the case, the police department asks Lueck to contact authorities. Wilking said the SLCPD will respect Lueck's privacy if she doesn't want to be contacted by family. ""She is an adult,"" he said. ""She has that right, as an adult, to basically check out, if she wants."" The University of Utah released a statement on Monday about Lueck's disappearance, saying she is enrolled part-time at the university and studying kinesiology and pre-nursing while minoring in health. ""The university's dean of students has spoken with Mackenzie's family to offer support and to express the campus community's shared hope for her safe return,"" the university said. ""The dean's office is also talking with and providing support to Mackenzie's classmates.""

'Look what I did to her sons.' Trump fires back at Barbara Bush remarks in new biography,"Video by Veuer WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump dismissed criticism from former first lady Barbara Bush detailed in a new book , saying he was not surprised by her words given that he had defeated her son for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. ""I have heard that she was nasty to me, but she should be,"" the president told The Washington Times in an interview published on Thursday. ""Look what I did to her sons."" Trump was responding to the former first lady's criticism included in a biography published this month , The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty, by USA TODAY Washington Bureau chief Susan Page. Excerpts of the book were first published in USA TODAY. In that book, Bush blamed Trump for aggravating her long battle with congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease. Bush also told Page that she'd ""probably say no"" when asked if she still considered herself a Republican. Bush, who died a year ago this month, and the Bush family had a tense relationship with Trump , who frequently criticized former President George W. Bush on the campaign trail in 2016. Trump also frequently derided former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of his opponents for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, dubbing him ""low energy Jeb."" ""I'm trying not to think about it,"" Barbara Bush said in an interview that took place in 2018 as the first anniversary of Trump's election approached. ""We're a strong country, and I think it will all work out."" Trump's remarks directed at Barbara Bush come after he has drawn criticism from fellow Republicans for a month-long assault on the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain, who died in August, had sharp words for the president toward the end of his life, and used his final speech on the Senate floor to call for a return to comity and bipartisanship in Washington.

"Lawmakers close in on confirming Cuomo's budget director to MTA board, say governor is now fully responsible for agency","Gov. Cuomo's budget director, Robert Mujica, is expected to join the MTA board, despite concerns over his upstate residency and potential conflicts of interest. The state Senate was considering Mujica's nomination late Wednesday after he was grilled in a pair of committee hearings over his relationship with the governor. Some lawmakers said the appointment forces Cuomo to take responsibility for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ""The only silver lining here is while the governor has been for years now evading responsibility for anything wrong with the MTA, he can no longer do that,"" said Sen. Gustavo Rivera (D-Bronx). Lawmakers were expected to provide Mujica with an exception to a law requiring Metropolitan Transportation Authority board members to reside in one of the 12 downstate counties served by the agency. The statute was expected to be bundled into a bill with other items and voted on at some point early Thursday. Rivera, the only member of the Finance Committee to vote against Mujica's nomination during a confirmation hearing, said the appointment was a ""direct conflict of interest."" During Mujica's confirmation hearing, Finance Committee Chairman Liz Krueger questioned whether the budget director's seat on the board violates the Public Authorities Reform Act of 2009 (PARA) , which requires that board members of public authorities like the MTA ""have an explicit fiduciary duty to the authority and not to the appointing entity."" Mujica said his potential conflicts of interest are no worse than some previous MTA board members and defended his independence. ""I'm independent, I've always been an independent person and I will continue to be independent on the MTA board,"" Mujica told the Finance Committee. ""This year there are many reforms that were made to the MTA by statute, including changing the board structure. There is a belief that there is rationale and a strong state interest to have the state budget director as a person who is on the board."" Rachael Fauss, an analyst at good-government group Reinvent Albany, criticized the move, saying ""MTA board members cannot serve two masters on MTA issues."" ""We believe it is inherently impossible for the state's budget director, who must sign off on numerous MTA contract and aid agreements, to fulfill his fiduciary duty as an MTA board member,"" said Fauss. ""We are extremely concerned that this major legislation is coming to a vote with zero opportunity for public comment under the guise of a confirmation hearing."" The Senate was also slated to confirm Cuomo's nomination of Department of Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell and Mayor de Blasio's nomination of the city's former Office of Labor Relations Commissioner Bob Linn to the board. Lawmakers did not move forward with Hizzonner's other MTA board nominee, the city's head climate policy adviser Dan Zarrilli, who was picked to fill the seat left vacant by Carl Weisbrod earlier this year. That means the mayor will continue to have three voting members instead of four on the MTA board while the agency completes a massive state-mandated reorganization.     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,New York Daily News,left
"warren jeffs' son, who spoke out against infamous polygamous leader, dies","Editor's note: The above video is an inside look at a northern Arizona community that used to be ruled by cult leader Warren Jeffs. SALT LAKE CITY (AP)   A man who spoke out against his infamous father who led a polygamous sect has died, his sister said Tuesday. Roy Jeffs was abused sexually and psychologically as a child by their father Warren Jeffs, and died by suicide May 29, his sister and brother said. He was 26. He was determined to tell his story to help other loved ones break away from the group controlled by their father, who is serving a life prison sentence in Texas after being convicted of sexually assaulting girls he considered wives. Roy Jeffs told The Associated Press in 2015 that his father controlled the group based along the Utah-Arizona state line with an iron fist, separating families and banning things such as movies and bicycles. PREVIOUSLY: Warren Jeffs' son talks of life in secretive polygamist sect Roy Jeffs' mother remained in the group, and the complete separation from her was especially painful for him. He never stopped trying to reach her, said his brother, Raymond Jeffs. A funeral is planned for Saturday, and the family has set up a GoFundMe account to help pay the costs. ""He never quit trying to have his voice heard, to make everyone realize what abuse Father had done to him, to his family to everyone,"" said Raymond Jeffs. He hoped that by speaking out he could eventually help the family reunite out of Warren Jeffs' grip, his sister Rachel Jeffs said. ""I know his whole goal was to bring the family together and be more kind to each other in a more loving world,"" she said. ""I know he just wanted everyone to be happy."" RELATED: Humanitarian aid takes root in Colorado City, Hilldale since arrest of Warren Jeffs Rachel Jeffs has publicly accused her father of sexually abusing her as well. Warren Jeffs refused an AP request for comment made through Texas prison officials on Tuesday, and no lawyer or representative could immediately be found for comment. The group known as The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not have a spokesman or a phone listing where leaders can be contacted. Rachel Jeffs said her father continues to control the group from prison. Roy Jeffs said he was sexually abused by his father before he turned 6 years old. He finally decided to leave after years of being controlled, manipulated and shuffled around the country to atone for perceived transgressions, he told the AP. ""If I think about too hard, think about everything that has happened, it just breaks me down real bad,"" he said in 2015. He said his father imposed his control over followers by reassigning children and wives to different men, sending people to ""houses of hiding"" and wielding the constant threat of exile. Cellphones, toys, movies, the internet, bicycles and even swimming have been strictly forbidden. ""I just want the truth to be out there,"" Roy Jeffs said. ""I want that information to be there so when people are questioning things and they are looking around, my story is there.""

meghan markle has been branded 'difficult' by tabloids. it's the same sexism that demonizes driven women in the workplace.,"Tabloids have reported that Meghan Markle is known among palace staff as ""duchess difficult,"" Me-Gain,"" and ""Hurricane Meghan."" She has been said to send emails to her staff at 5 a.m. and ""bombards"" her aides with texts. Disparaging a member of the royal family for having too many ideas or caring too much about charity work is ridiculous. It rings of the sexism that often demonizes driven women as ""abrasive"" or ""bossy"" while men are praised for being ""aggressive."" People love tearing down powerful women by dismissing them as difficult divas. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories. Kensington Palace is notoriously tight-lipped about rumors regarding members of the royal family. But throughout Meghan Markle's first year as a royal, reports have surfaced featuring unflattering nicknames for the Duchess of Sussex such as "" duchess difficult, "" "" Me-Gain, "" and "" Hurricane Meghan ."" The supposed grievances that have earned Markle these titles include waking up at 5 a.m., ""bombarding"" her aides with texts , and holding ""undercover"" meetings with British citizens affiliated with charitable causes. Angela Levin, royal biographer and author of ""Harry: Conversations with the Prince,"" also said in the CBS special ""Harry and Meghan Plus One"" that Markle is ""not popular"" among Prince Harry's friends because ""they seem to think that she's running the show."" Indeed, Markle is already the patron of four different organizations, two of which were handed down to her directly by Queen Elizabeth . She's also been known to break royal protocol when interacting with the public the way Princess Diana often did. She opts for hugs over handshakes, wears pantsuits instead of more traditional royal formal wear , and is a proud feminist which is perhaps enough to ruffle some feathers in British high society. Read more : Every time Meghan Markle broke royal protocol Controversy surrounding Markle's role in the royal family is not new Even before she and Harry were engaged, Markle was subject to such a volatile "" wave of abuse and harassment "" from members of the press and anonymous trolls that Harry's communications secretary issued a rare statement condemning the ""outright sexism and racism"" she faced. The scrutiny has only intensified since the royal couple married last year and welcomed their son Archie in May, thrusting them even further into the public eye. These days, Markle is being labeled ""difficult"" and unpopular because it seems that she's ""running the show."" This type of gender bias is also not new. Disparaging Markle for having too many ideas or caring too much about charity work rings of the sexism that often demonizes driven women A 2012 study published in Research in Organizational Behavior found that descriptive gender stereotypes (ideas about what women are like) and prescriptive gender stereotypes (ideas about what women should be like) impede women's professional advancement . When women exhibit a more assertive leadership style stereotypically associated with men, they face ""disapproval and social penalties"" that keep them from getting promoted. One study of women in tech published in Fortune found that women are more often called ""abrasive"" and ""bossy"" in performance reviews while men are praised for being ""aggressive."" A Skyline Group International report also found that "" Women who check detailed progress every day are seen as micromanaging and bossy "" and that ""employees are more receptive to women in leadership who present themselves with poise and authenticity."" All of Markle's supposed transgressions - waking up early, sending ideas and delegating tasks to her staff, holding meetings with potential partners - sound like a woman with ambition. What's truly ""difficult"" is why people feel the need to ridicule her for it.

"Police in California shot 55 times in 3.5 seconds and killed Willie McCoy. That's 'reasonable,' report says","The family attorney for a slain California rapper on Thursday dismissed an independent report that found officers acted reasonably in the February shooting, saying he expected the city of Vallejo would hire an expert to support police. The report released this week found that six officers fired 55 times at 20-year-old Willie McCoy in the span of 3.5 seconds shortly after he woke up from sleeping in his car in the drive-thru lane of a Taco Bell restaurant. Attorney John Burris told USA TODAY he believed the report was irrelevant, particularly since the hired expert also deemed police had probable cause in the fatal 2018 shooting of Stephon Clark . ""It only means to me that local police agencies have found a person they can count on to support their position,"" Burris said. 'Sitting duck': Police release bodycam video in fatal shooting of California rapper The independent use of force report ordered by the city concluded each officer had probable cause to believe McCoy posed an immediate threat. The report's author, David Blake, a police consultant and retired peace officer, also wrote that police had reasonable suspicion to detain McCoy, who was found unconscious in his car while in possession of a gun. Blake reviewed video footage and interviewed officers and witnesses to inform his opinions. ""Officers are not required to wait until a weapon is pointed at them to take the necessary steps to save their own lives,"" Blake wrote in the report , adding that their actions were ""reasonable based upon my training and experience as a range instructor as well as through applied human factors psychology."" His consulting office did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. Charges: Police killings of black men in the U.S. and what happened to the officers City Attorney Claudia Quintana said the independent report is not expected to affect the investigations by the Vallejo Police Department or Solano County District Attorney's Office. It may take nearly two years for the office to issue a final report, police have previously said . The report released this week was prepared in anticipation of civil litigation, Quintana said in an email to USA TODAY. Burris has filed a wrongful death and civil rights violation claim against the city. He said a federal lawsuit is also planned. The incident, Burris said, is one of more than 10 pending cases he is working that accuse the Vallejo Police Department of racial profiling and excessive force. Burris said the independent report will not affect his assessment on McCoy's case. ""These officers used deathly force tactics,"" Burris said. ""They wake a man up and, before he has a chance to react, they shoot and kill him. That cannot be reasonable."" Related slideshow: Over-reaction or unavoidable shooting in Vallejo?

Boston Globe explains why it hasn't surfaced David Ortiz shooting rumors,"One of the downsides of being an owned by a multibillionaire with extensive business ties to local institutions is the conflict of interest question. For the Boston Globe, which is owned by John Henry, this dilemma arises whenever there's unflattering Red Sox news. So it is unsurprising some questions are starting to arise about the paper's coverage of David Ortiz's shooting. It's been 15 days since Ortiz was shot at close range in the lower back at a bar in his native Dominican Republic. He's finally been moved out of intensive care at Mass General Hospital and seems to be on his way towards recovery. Big Papi underwent two extensive surgeries, one in Santo Domingo and another back in Boston, in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Last week, Dominican authorities announced they determined Ortiz wasn't the intended target of the apparent assassination attempt, contradicting some of their previous statements in court documents. The Globe, to its credit, has published at least three articles that question the Attorney General's claim: Dan Shaughnessy's column about the explanation's lack of believability, interviews with Dominicans who doubt the authorities, and an explainer piece about the Dominican's corrupt police force . But the Globe hasn't surfaced any alternative theories about the motive, which have circulated elsewhere. Several outlets, including the Daily Mail and New York Post, have quoted anonymous Dominican sources who say Ortiz was carrying on a romantic affair with a drug kingpin's wife. The woman, model Maria Garcia, is videotaped getting into an altercation with members of Ortiz's entourage at the Santo Domingo hospital the night he was shot. Ortiz also purchased Garcia an $84,500 Lexus the day before the episode. ""Question for the @bostonglobe: have you established whether that $84,500 Lexus bill of sale and payment are authentic? Or that video showing an altercation outside Ortiz's DR hospital room?,"" tweeted WGBH correspondent Adam Reilly . In an email exchange with WEEI.com, Globe managing editor Jennifer Peter explained the paper's decision to not publish any of the rumors -- yet. ""We've obviously seen the same stories you have, but we don't surface rumors,"" she replied. ""We do reporting, which is ongoing in this case."" With at least 11 suspects already arrested, this complex case is just getting started. But if authorities didn't offer any additional information about Ortiz, the public will lose interest, if it hasn't already. There appears to be universal skepticism about the mistaken identity theory. But it could take an uncomfortable amount of digging to uncover any deep-seated truths. This high-profile shooting case involving one of Boston's most beloved sports stars may forever be clouded in mystery.",crime,Boston Globe,left
"'pathetic rout,' 'tragic mistake' and 'painful'   john mccain holds little back in describing helsinki","Video by CNBC Of all the critical statements issued about Monday's Helsinki happenings, the one by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain perhaps stood out the most, as the Arizona Republican accused President Donald Trump of making a ""tragic mistake"" in his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the joint press conference that followed. The Republican pulled no punches in his latest verbal fisticuffs with the president, issuing a lengthy statement from Arizona about what may he thinks may be incalculable damage to U.S. foreign policy. McCain's absence from the Capitol has been obvious throughout his battle with brain cancer, but no more so than during debates over the relationship between the United States and Russia, as well as between the U.S. and NATO allies. The full statement from McCain appears below: ""Today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. The damage inflicted by President Trump's naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake. ""President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world. ""It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout   as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. But these were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin's regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. ""Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today's press conference marks a recent low point in the history of the American Presidency. That the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisors makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable. ""No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are   a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed. Americans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility.

"The tree that inspired Dr. Seuss' ""The Lorax"" has fallen over","An iconic Cypress tree located in the picturesque seaside town of La Jolla, California, has apparently fallen over, according to local reports. The tree is more than an imposing plant   it inspired an important story by celebrated children's author Dr. Seuss. Theodore Seuss Geisel   aka Dr. Seuss   moved to the ritzy beach town after World War II, according to The Smithsonian. He lived in an observation tower, which gave him stunning views of La Jolla, including Scripps Park, where a rare Monterey Cypress stood. This unique-looking tree is believed to be the inspiration behind Dr. Seuss' ""The Lorax,"" a story about conservation, according to the city of La Jolla. The book, written in 1971, tells a tale of a man who builds up his business at the expense of ""Truffula trees"" and the creatures who rely on them. It was made into a popular star-studded kids movie in 2012 that featured Taylor Swift, Danny De Vito, Betty White and Zac Efron. Dr. Seuss, who was environmentally conscious and often wrote about conservation, was concerned about the trees in La Jolla, the city says. He was upset that billboards and construction threatened the ecosystem and was thus inspired to create a story about the fictional ""Truffula trees."" The ""Truffula trees"" and other foliage illustrated in Dr. Seuss' whimsical books resemble the greenery in La Jolla. However, one particular tree is somewhat of a star. ""Ask anyone in town where the Lorax tree is, and they'll point you here,"" the Smithsonian says. It's unclear what caused the tree to fall. The city plans to salvage and repurpose part of the tree trunk and will also replant a replacement in the area. CBS News has reached out to the San Diego Parks and Recreation Department for more information. Some Monterey Cypress trees can live hundreds of years   but this particular one was between 80 and 100. The fictional Truffula will fortunately live on in ""The Lorax.""",environmental issues,CBS News,left
fair lawn man who molested his ex-girlfriend's 15-month-old daughter wants new trial,"A Fair Lawn man convicted of molesting his ex-girlfriend's baby girl is seeking another trial because a witness who was present at the time the assault is said to have occurred did not testify. A judge in Hackensack will decide next month if there is sufficient evidence to reopen the case against John Katsigiannis, who has been was tried twice on sexual assault charges. His first trial in 2011 ended with a hung jury, and he was convicted on the second attempt in 2012. Robert Pierce, his current attorney, believes he might be exonerated by a witness who testified in the first trial, but was not called for the second. The witness, Katsigiannis's friend, is crucial because he testified that Katsigiannis and the victim's mother were in the room together during the incident, Pierce said. The mother, however, claimed that Katsigiannis had locked her out. ""We believe that testimony made the difference,"" Pierce said. Kastigiannis' first trial ended in Nov. 2011 with a deadlocked jury after five days of deliberations. A year later, in Nov. 2012, a jury needed only 20 minutes to convict him. EX-COP ON TRIAL: Former cop on trial for Midland Park machete killing 'knew it was wrong,' doctor testifies DOUBLE MURDER: Couple kept a tidy home in a neighborhood that can be rough Katsigiannis, 36, is currently serving a 15-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting the infant during a barbecue with friends at his home in June 2007. Though he claimed his finger slipped while changing the girl, prosecutors said the assault was made with such force that she required surgery. A three-judge Appellate Division panel upheld Kastigiannis' conviction on appeal in 2014, but Pierce said he can still win a new trial by raising arguments through a motion for post-conviction relief. Prosecutors have argued that Katsigiannis was convicted because he initially gave differing stories to police, and later admitted that his finger slipped, which caused the injury to the girl. At a Feb. 11 hearing, Demetra Agriantonis Maurice, an assistant prosecutor who tried both cases, said Katsigiannis' friend was not central to the trial, and admitted to feeling drowsy that day after taking several medications for a back injury. ""His credibility was called into question and he wasn't that credible of a witness,"" she said. Katsigiannis testified that he too was drinking beer and smoking marijuana with several friends at the barbecue before going inside the home to change the baby. During the changing, he said he saw what looked like a piece of cotton and reached down to grab it, but then saw blood on his fingertip. Katsigiannis said neither he nor the mother took the baby to the hospital until hours later, when they found a lot more blood on the baby's diaper. Doctors were suspicious about the injury and alerted police. After hours of cross-examination, Katsigiannis said he gave false statements to protect his ex-girlfriend, who was fearful of child services. The mother also told doctors, police and detectives that she was present for the changing before retracting her story. .

Oregon Democrats Set to Back Down on Climate Bill That Sent GOP Lawmakers Into Hiding,"Oregon Democrats appear set to abandon the climate-change bill that prompted Republican state senators to flee the state, after the Democratic state senate president said Tuesday that the bill doesn't have enough votes to pass. If Democrats do back down from the bill, it'll be a win for the Republicans who left the state to block it and for the right-wing militias who threatened to shoot state police if they tried to bring the senators back to the capital for a vote. In a speech first reported by The Oregonian , state Senate President Peter Courtney (D) said the bill doesn't have enough support from Democrats themselves. ""House Bill 2020 does not have the votes on the Senate floor,"" he said. ""That will not change."" Democrats can afford to lose two of their own votes while still passing the bill, Willamette Week reported . Two Democratic state senators have already criticized the bill, suggesting that a third, still-unnamed Democrat opposes it. Other interests, including pressure from the state's timber industry, could be at play. In his speech, Courtney mentioned the other bills that would die if Republicans don't return to the senate in an apparent attempt to salvage the rest of the legislative session that ends June 30. The prospect of the carbon-cap bill passing in Oregon, where Democrats hold the governorship and supermajorities in both legislative chambers, sent the state's senate Republicans fleeing to Idaho in an attempt to deny the senate a quorum. Gov. Kate Brown (D), who sent state police to bring the Republican senators back, blasted the fugitive lawmakers in a statement on Tuesday. ""Are they against climate change legislation or are they against democracy?"" Brown said. "" If they are not back by Wednesday afternoon, we will know the answer."" The bill's apparent failure is a blow to Oregon progressives, who failed to pass a climate change bill despite Democrats controlling the entire state government. Amy Herzfeld-Copple, the deputy director for the left-leaning Western States Center, called the bill's potential demise a serious disappointment. ""What's most disheartening for me in all of this is that our democratic institutions were undermined, a major political party cozied up to militia and paramilitary groups to achieve their political goals, and the planet and our children and our community's future suffered,"" Herzfeld-Copple told The Daily Beast. While both Republicans and Democratic minorities across the country have used quorum-busting walkouts in the past, the Oregon walkout made national headlines after militias offered to help the Republicans and state Sen. Brian Boquist (R) implied he would shoot police officers himself if they tried to bring him back to the state. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

"California couple abused Guatemalan immigrants, forcing them to work, prosecutors say","A California couple has been charged with forcing a Guatemalan woman and her two children to work in the couple's Shasta Lake businesses, the U.S. attorney's office announced Monday. Nery Martinez Vasquez and Maura Martinez, who are both 50-year-old naturalized U.S. citizens, were indicted on charges of forced labor, conspiracy to commit forced labor, harboring an alien for financial gain and conspiracy to commit alien harboring, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, the Martinezes paid $5,139 to bring the immigrant woman and her two young daughters to the U.S. with temporary visitor visas and then forced them to stay and work for them after their visas expired. The indictment states that woman and her daughters were subjected to physical, verbal and psychological abuse between September 2016 when they arrived at Shasta Lake and February 2018. The Guatemalan family, unnamed in court records, was promised a better life in the U.S., with a livable wage and education for the young girls, who were born in 2001 and 2008, prosecutors said. Instead, the three were made to live in a trailer in the backyard of the Martinez home with no heating, air conditioning or running water, the indictment states. Prosecutors said the family was told they could not get a cellphone and the girls could not go to school because immigration authorities would find them and deport them. When the mother expressed a desire in January 2017 to return to Guatemala, the couple told her she owed them $12,000   though they paid only $5,139 for the family's travel arrangements   and could not go back home until she worked another 16 months for them, according to the indictment. Court records indicate that the woman and her older daughter worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week at the couple's restaurant, Latino's, and at Redding Carpet Cleaning & Janitorial Services for far below minimum wage and that the younger girl worked several hours a day for no pay. Aside from the forced labor, the woman and her daughters were physically abused and degraded, prosecutors said. On multiple occasions, the woman was forced to eat leftover scraps of food, humiliated in front of her daughters and threatened with whippings with a vacuum cord, the indictment states. The girls also were repeatedly struck with a stick, according to the indictment. If convicted of the forced labor charges, the Martinezes face up to 20 years in prison. The harboring charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Neither prosecution nor defense attorneys could immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. alejandra.reyesvelarde@latimes.com Twitter: @r_valejandra",crime,Los Angeles Times,left
Virgin will be the fastest train ever in the southern U.S. when Orlando service starts,"When Virgin Trains, then known as Brightline, opened up its Miami Central station a year ago launching express service from downtown Miami to West Palm Beach, it represented a milestone in the future of travel. Last week, company representatives said an even bigger milestone is coming down the tracks, once its planned West Palm-to-Orlando route is complete. In a presentation given Thursday to the Central Florida Expressway Authority, Virgin confirmed that a portion of the route will reach a top speed of 125 miles per hour. That would make it the fastest train ever built in the southern U.S., and, as the Orlando Sentinel first noted , only a few gasps behind the northeast corridor's Acela, which tops out at 150 miles per hour. All told, a trip from Miami Central Station to Orlando International will take approximately three hours, shaving about a half hour off drive time. The company will use existing Florida East Coast track to snake up the east coast before hitting CFX's existing transit corridor in southeast Orange county. There, it will lay down all-new track as it turns west near Cocoa Beach and travels adjacent to FL-528 to Orlando International, said Virgin Executive Vice President of Rail Infrastructure Adrian Share. Construction on the extension began in Orlando in May; an official ribbon cutting is now slated for June 24, Share said. Plans to extend the route to Tampa, as well as Orlando venues like the area around Disney, remain in preliminary phases. Company officials reaffirmed no state funds are being used to finance the $4 billion, 167-mile extension, which is set to begin service in 2022. The company did access federal tax breaks in issuing more than $2 billion in bonds for the project. Meanwhile, Share said, ridership figures remain on track  despite a slide in its passenger count and revenues. In its most recent investor filing, covering the month of April, Virgin said it carried 71,308 passengers, generating total revenues of approximately $1.8 million, down from 91,903 passengers and $2.3 million in revenues in March. The company said commuter and frequent business-traveler ridership was up, while leisure-oriented ridership was lower ""due to lower seasonal event activity."" Share also said the company is still ramping up its ridership. Share hinted that Virgin plans to expand beyond Florida and Las Vegas, where it has also purchased the rights to a rail corridor extending from Sin City to the outskirts of Los Angeles. ""Our approach to these projects is to look for candidates that have city centers that are too long to drive and too short to fly,"" Share said. ""We look at an approach where we can build smartly, affordably, and...maximize the use of existing corridors.""     ©2019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Miami Herald,left
air force grounds turkish pilots in arizona over military disagreement,"The U.S. Department of Defense has grounded Turkish F-35 pilots who were training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona in anticipation of the potential discontinuation of the Turkish F-35 program, Foreign Policy magazine reports . The decision comes after Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan sent a letter to Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar saying the U.S will no longer train Turkish pilots and will not provide F-35s to Turkey if the country moves forward with purchasing Russian S-400 missile systems. In the letter, he said that the two systems, the American-made F-35 jets and the S-400 missiles, cannot exist side by side, according to the Department of Defense. The department perceives Turkey's purchase of the missiles as a security threat. ""These actions are intended to mediate risks posed by the S-400 to the F-35,"" Under Secretary of Defense Ellen Lord told reporters at a Friday news briefing. The situation further strains the already tense relationship between the U.S. and Turkey, in part because of disagreements over the war in Syria, the Associated Press reported from Ankara, Turkey. For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com . In his letter, Shanahan gave the longtime NATO ally a July 31 deadline to discontinue its S-400 purchase. It seems, though, the unraveling of the Turkish F-35 program already has begun. On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman told Foreign Policy that the Turkish pilots at Luke are no longer flying , despite the July 31 deadline. Also, a new group of pilots who were to scheduled to arrive at Luke in June for training did not come, Lord said at the news briefing. Arizona base trains pilots from around world Luke Air Force Base, located northwest of Camelback and Litchfield roads in west Glendale, trains 70% of the world's F-35 pilots. That includes pilots from the U.S., Turkey, Australia, Italy, Norway, Singapore and South Korea. There are two Turkish instructors and four Turkish pilots at Luke, said Becky Heyse, a base spokeswoman. The first Turkish pilots arrived at the base in 2016. The U.S. and Turkey are two of the original partner countries that agreed to purchase the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet from Lockheed Martin. The base trains pilots from the partner countries and other countries purchasing the F-35. Luke received its first F-35 in 2014, and as of February was up to 85. The base's goal was to eventually have 144 F-35s. The original timeline for the arrival of the jets is now delayed . It's unclear how, if the Turkish program is discontinued, the number of planes and pilots at Luke will be affected. Luke referred all questions to the U.S. Department of Defense. A spokesperson did not immediately return an email request for comment. Turkey has four jets at Luke Turkey planned to purchase 100 F-35s, according to the Department of Defense. The country already purchased four of the jets, and they are located at Luke right now, according to Lord. The U.S. and Turkey are negotiating what will happen to those jets if the U.S. cancels its participation in the program. Two of the jets arrived in June 2018, and the other two arrived in spring 2019, Heyse said. Lt. Col. Mike Andrews told Foreign Policy that the reason the pilots were grounded before the deadline was Brig. General Todd Canterbury, who commands the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke, was concerned with continuing to allow Turkish pilots access to sensitive data.

U.S. Sues Omarosa Manigault-Newman for Ethics Violations,"(Bloomberg) -- Omarosa Manigault-Newman, who rose from contestant on Donald Trump's reality TV show to loyal aide to the president, was sued by the U.S. for failing to file a financial disclosure report, in violation of the Ethics in Government Act. The civil lawsuit, filed in Washington federal court, seeks an court order compelling her to file the report and pay a fine of as much as $50,000. It's the latest twist in a head-spinning relationship that began with Manigault-Newman's featured appearance in ""The Apprentice"" and ended with a 2018 book about the president she called ""Unhinged."" Manigault-Newman's lawyer, John Phillips, said the lawsuit was ""premature, retaliatory and an attempt to silence a dissenting voice."" After leaving the administration, where she was an assistant to the president, Manigault-Newman wrote a tell-all book that questioned Trump's stability, and she released several conversations she surreptitiously taped at the White House. Trump has attacked Manigault-Newman repeatedly. ""When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out,"" he said in a Twitter posting. He also claimed she violated a non-disclosure agreement by writing the tome. Manigault-Newman's White House employment ended on Dec. 19, 2017, and she was notified by the counsel's office that she had to file an exit disclosure statement by Jan. 18, 2018, according to the complaint. Despite repeated requests since then, she has still not filed, the U.S. claims. Phillips said Manigault-Newman has made repeated requests for documents of hers withheld by the White House and which she needs to file. ""It wasn't until May 10, 2019, that they agreed to provide documents or even acknowledged their existence,"" the attorney said. ""We requested an extension until her documents could be returned.""

san antonio kids shine at summer drama camp plays,"Smoke swirled across the stage at Highlands High School as Pugsley Addams wondered aloud about the changes going on in his family. Twenty people watched in the darkened theater as the boy in a striped shirt worried whether he would still be teased by Wednesday, his sister full of woe, if he was no longer the center of her attention. ""What if she doesn't torture me anymore?"" he asked plaintively, as several ghouls shambled around him. It wasn't 11-year-old Marley Lujan's first time acting on stage. The student from Bonham Academy has been acting for five years. But he said he had to bring his A-game when he auditioned for the part of Pugsley. ""It's really fun to be on stage,"" Marley said after the rehearsal. ""It's an experience for me and my friends."" Capping a three-week summer drama camp, Marley and 60 fellow middle and high school students from San Antonio Independent School District performed two shows each night Thursday and Friday at Highlands: the musical ""The Addams Family"" and a one-act play, ""Sins of Sor Juana."" OnExpressNews.com : SAISD settles with parent for $150,000 over sign language services For the past three weeks they have memorized lines, built sets and followed stage direction, at the SAISD-sponsored drama camp located on Elgin Avenue. Sara Smith, Highlands theater director and musical co-director, said the district has offered the summer camp for more than 10 years. She said the students auditioned in May and cast was announced the first day of camp. ""The kids have learned so much … in this expedited creative process,"" she said. ""It's more than 'Hey, let's do a show.' "" Smith said the students learn stage presence and backstage techniques as they bond over shared experiences. ""It brings our kids in the district closer together,"" she said, ""and they develop friendships."" Katelyn Nolen, 15, who played Uncle Fester in the musical, fretted over her gray-painted bald cap as she sat in the cafeteria with Marley after their last rehearsal. The Highlands High School student said she looks forward to roles where she can kick it into high gear and interact with the audience. ""Usually I tell people who want that experience to sit in the front row and I'll talk directly to them,"" she said. The young actors and crew had a turn at serious drama, too, with the ""Sins of Sor Juana."" Rebecca Phillips, a theater director at Jefferson High, and Campbell Duncan, a technical theater teacher at Dripping Springs High School, directed the students in the play, about a woman whose intelligence was dismissed and suppressed by men in the late 1600s. The production is based on the real-life Mexican scholar Juana Inés de la Cruz who had her intellect tested by 40 scholars and furthered her studies as a nun until her death. ""It's an important story and the kids are doing a phenomenal job,"" Duncan said. ""They're very protective of the story."" READ ALSO : SAISD staff to receive raises The play followed the musical as the productions were performed in a Black Box theater, where the audience sits mere feet away from the actors. Duncan compared the play to a movie, where the audience members become part of the action. Joelle Macdonald, 18, a Young Women's Leadership Academy graduate, played the lead role, Juana. This was her first lead since she began acting in the eighth grade. It was her fifth time participating in the summer camp. She said her family supports her pursuit of acting. Typically a shy person, Joelle said she feels up to the challenge of taking on another persona. ""It's an adrenaline rush,"" Joelle said of being onstage, ""and it's so exciting.

2 more deputies fired after shooting at Florida high school,"MIAMI (AP)   Two additional deputies have been fired as a result of an internal affairs investigation into the agency's response to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people, the Broward County sheriff said Wednesday. At a brief news conference, Sheriff Gregory Tony said deputies Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were fired Tuesday for their inaction following the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting. ""In essence, it was neglect of duty. We lost 17 people,"" Tony said. A state investigative commission found that Stambaugh was working an off-duty shift at a nearby school when he responded to reports of shots fired at the school. He got out of his truck, put on his bulletproof vest and took cover for about five minutes after hearing the shots, according to body camera footage. He then drove to a nearby highway instead of going toward the school. Eason ran the other way as gunfire continued, then spent time putting on his bulletproof vest and body camera while the carnage continued, investigators said. Eason was also faulted for not writing an official report after receiving a tip in February 2016 that the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, was making threats on social media to shoot up a school. Tips to the FBI about Cruz also were not followed up, a separate investigation has found. Two other deputies were fired earlier this month for neglect of duty. One of those was school resource officer Scot Peterson, who was also arrested on charges of child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury. Peterson's lawyer has said he will fight the charges. The sheriff said no action was taken on three other deputies who were involved in the investigation. Scott Israel, the sheriff at the time, was removed from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for similar reasons. He is appealing that decision before the state Senate. Cruz, 20, faces the death penalty if convicted in the shootings. His lawyers have said he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence but prosecutors have rejected that offer.",crime,AP,center

Google's new AI can help you speak another language in your own voice,"Google Translate is one of the company's most used products. It helps people translate one language to another through typing, taking pics of text, and using speech-to-text technology. Now, the company's launching a new project called Translatotron, which will offer direct speech-to-speech translations   without even using any text. In a post on Google's AI blog , the team behind the tool explained that instead of using speech-to-text and then text-to-speech to convert voice, it relied on a new model (which runs on a neural network) to develop the new system. ""Dubbed Translatotron , this system avoids dividing the task into separate stages, providing a few advantages over cascaded systems, including faster inference speed, naturally avoiding compounding errors between recognition and translation, making it straightforward to retain the voice of the original speaker after translation, and better handling of words that do not need to be translated (e.g., names and proper nouns),"" the Google research team wrote in the blog post. Translatotron can also preserve the characteristics of the voice of the speaker when translating from one language to another. This could be really useful to sound editors who dub movies and TV shows. The researchers have admitted that translations from the new model are not as precise as traditional models, but they're confident the accuracy of the new model will soon improve. There are plenty of apps out there like iTranslate and SayHi that try to translate one language to another using voice. But they're still not as smooth and error-free as one would like. Considering this still a model (and theres not even a demo available yet), chances are Google will take a while to implement the new system in consumer-grade solutions. I, for one, am looking forward to trying it out though. You can read more about Google's new technology here, and you can read more about the model the research team used here .",science,Google,left
prospect park nj school official: i was forced from my job,"PROSPECT PARK   Louis Turco, whose tenure as the public school's business administrator ended Sunday, said the Board of Education forced him from his position against his will. Turco's claim is the latest black mark to sully the school board's image. In the past month, school officials have faced a demonstration by teachers over the non-renewal of a popular security officer, and the release of findings by the Office of the New Jersey State Comptroller that detailed lapses in the K-8 district's operations. Turco, who was paid an annual salary of $109,000 as business administrator, alleged that ""politics"" were to blame for his being pushed out of the job he held for two years. ""For it to come to an end the way it did   it's very sad,"" said Turco, a longtime trustee on the Hawthorne school board. ""I take my responsibility to heart, and my work is important to me. I really didn't want to leave."" Referring to his feeling of being pressured to resign, he added, ""I don't know this for sure, but my gut would tell me that there's others to come."" The district has been under scrutiny for suspicions that it has been manipulated by Mayor Mohamed Khairullah. Turco said he sensed that his job was in jeopardy in the fall, when gossip began to swirl that three school board candidates supported by Khairullah would ""clean house"" if they won the general election. The Khairullah-backed candidates routed their opponents by a 3-1 ratio. LOCAL: Teachers, students protest in Prospect Park TRENDING: Search called off for Montclair couple missing in Barbados K-8 DISTRICT: Prospect Park school audit finds 'key' failures And in February, the trio appeared to make good on the rumors when they, and two of their colleagues, terminated the school board's attorney and auditor to replace them with companies believed to be linked to Khairullah. That action, vehemently opposed by trustees Frank Caraccio and André Greer, resulted in complaints filed with the New Jersey School Ethics Commission. In March, Schools Superintendent Allison Angermeyer wanted to put Turco's contract on a school board agenda for renewal, but according to him, she was asked to ""hold off."" ""That was very telling to me,"" Turco said, ""and I began to look for a job."" Calls seeking comments were not returned by Angermeyer, Khairullah or school board President Mohammed Hussain. Turco said the school board passed a resolution in April to advertise for his position. ""They never told me that I was out of a job,"" he said. ""But the writing was on the wall."" Turco said he initially applied for his own job but later withdrew his résumé when he got ""positive feedback"" from another prospective employer. The school board accepted Turco's resignation on June 18. He started a new job on Monday as business administrator for the Northvale K-8 district   a school system of comparable size to Prospect Park's. Turco's successor, Carl Morelli, also started on Monday. He will be paid $90,000 per year. Morelli, of Madison, has worked in six different high schools as a teacher. He most recently taught business classes at Abraham Clark High School in Roselle. ""Everyone here would like to see the school do better,"" Morelli said, addressing recent issues that have dogged Prospect Park's district.

50 Years Later: The pen that saved Apollo 11,"If it weren't for a small felt-tipped pen and the quick thinking of the astronauts, the outcome of the Apollo 11 mission could have ended in disaster. On July 20, 1969, the first men to land on the moon, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, had been on the moon's surface collecting rock and dust samples for almost three hours. As they were climbing back into the Lunar Module (LM) in preparation to return home, Aldrin hit the circuit breaker switch with the life support backpack on his suit. ""It's very cumbersome,"" Armstrong said. ""You're like the Frankenstein monster. And you have this big backpack on your back."" (MORE: 'Apollo 50: Go for the Moon' visuals to depict Saturn V on Washington Monument) The switch (ENG ARM) activates the spacecraft's ascent engine to lift them off the moon so they could rendezvous with Michael Collins, who was in the Columbia command module orbiting overhead. ""He could've picked something that was not very important,"" Armstrong said. ""But he banged into the circuit breaker that controlled the SM engine that got us back into orbit."" Armstrong and Aldrin did not think the circuit breaker would trip on liftoff, but they wanted to be sure. ""It was just insurance. It's nice to get a little insurance,"" Armstrong said. The astronauts notified Mission Control by radio, but they had already disposed of most of their tools aboard to make the module lighter.

Marital woes apparent in phone messages between Shanann and Christopher Watts ahead of brutal murders,"Video by CBS Nov. 22--Just months before Christopher Watts' killed his family and dumped their bodies, his wife recorded a heartfelt video of her surprising him with news of her third pregnancy. Shanann Watts was sporting a shirt with the words ""Oops... we did it again,"" when her husband arrived home the evening of May 29, according to documents obtained by CBS Denver in response to a Colorado Criminal Justice records request. Video recorded of the moment reportedly sees Watts looking confused before he realizes the implications of her tee and breaks out into a grin. ""I guess when you want to, it happens -- wow,"" he tells her after an embrace. Watts killed his wife and their two daughters, Celeste and Bella, in August -- a little more than two months after she surprised him with her pregnancy news in the kitchen of their home. He made a desperate plea for their safe return on local news outlets, but was arrested just days later. He submitted to the Frederick Police for a polygraph test, during which investigators determined he was not being truthful with them. When confronted about his deception, Watts confessed to killing his wife but tried to blame her for the deaths of their children. Watts earlier this month pleaded guilty to the nine charges he faced, including five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of murdering a child, one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body. On Monday, he was sentenced to life behind bars without possibility of parole. In the weeks after the gleeful pregnancy video was recorded, problems seem to crop up quickly -- their subsequent phone exchanges a far cry from the hugging couple eager to welcome another child into the world. Shanann Watts in July expressed her frustration with her in-laws and discussed what seemed to be enduring marital problems with Watts, according to CBS Denver. ""I try to give you space, but while you are working and living the bachelor life I'm carrying our 3rd and fighting with our two kids daily and trying to work and make money,"" she texted him. ""It's not hard texting love you and miss you. If you don't mean it then I get it, but we need to talk. I kept looking at my phone all night and no response from you. Like seriously! We didn't just start dating yesterday! We've been together for 8 years and have 2.5 kids together!"" The night of August 5, just days before she was murdered, Shanann offered a desperate plea to her husband, who at the time was reportedly having an affair with a colleague. ""I missed everything about you. I couldn't wait to touch you, hold you, kiss you, make love to you, smell you, laugh with you,"" she wrote. ""I couldn't wait to celebrate 8 years with you... If you are done, don't love me, don't want to work this out, not happy anymore and only staying because of the kids, I NEED you to tell me."" She then asked whether he would stay if they didn't have kids before firing off a text, wondering how Watts could sleep. ""I just don't get it. You don't fall out of love in 5 weeks,"" she texted. ""How can you sleep? Our marriage is crumbling in front of us and you can sleep."" Shanann Watts was 15 weeks pregnant when her body was discovered in August on the property of one of Colorado's largest oil and gas drillers, where her husband previously worked. The bodies of 3-year-old Bella and 4-year-old Celeste meanwhile were found submerged inside ""mostly full"" oil and gas tanks on the property. ___ (c)2018 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",crime,New York Daily News,left
gaston restaurateur talks cyber policy in washington,"The owner of two popular Gaston County restaurants went to Washington recently to talk about digital policy with members of Congress. John Bailey, who owns Sammy's Pub in Belmont and McAdenville Table and Market with his father, Jim, was one of two North Carolinians chosen by the Connected Commerce Council to talk about how digital tools help business -- and how privacy regulations might have unintended consequences. Bailey met with U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents Gaston County in Congress, and other elected officials in the marathon session. ""They chose me to go to Washington for a fly-in to basically help lobby Congress on some upcoming bills about internet data and safety and how those things affect my business,"" Bailey said. The Connected Commerce Council -- or 3C -- is a nonprofit that promotes small businesses' use of and access to the digital tools that are increasingly vital in a technology-driven world. As far as privacy goes, there's been increased talk in recent years about regulating social media platforms and other aspects of the tech industry that deal with data security and personal information. The nonprofit supports policies that protects consumers but doesn't hurt small businesses. ""Our country's biggest privacy risks are the companies that manage vast quantities of financial and health data,"" 3C says in summary of its advocacy issues. ""Small businesses should not be overwhelmed by information liability and data security regulations that create more cost than benefit."" Bailey and a commissioner from Rowan County were the only two people from North Carolina to be chosen by 3C for the trip, but he said a few dozen people ""from all over the country"" attended. At one point, the group attended a House Small Business Committee subcommittee meeting, Bailey said. ""The members we spoke to, for the most part, were very interested and wanted to hear what we had to say because we're all aware we have internet data breaches all the time,"" he said. ""Definitely something needs to be done about that. The concern of groups like 3C and myself is that if members of Congress pass regulations for industry giants like Facebook and Google and Yelp, who can afford to hire compliance attorneys to make sure they do what they're supposed to, how does that affect mom-and-pops like me?"" Bailey said social media platforms help small businesses reach larger audience ""on penny budgets."" The group also met with U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina's 8th District and toured the Capitol. Bailey said the tour was partially arranged by former U.S. Rep. Heath Shuler, who represented much of the Asheville area from 2007-2013. ""We got to go out onto the speaker's balcony at night, which was really, really great,"" Bailey said. In addition to giving business owners a chance to share their thoughts, the trip also gave the group insight into the lawmaking process. ""I'm glad I payed attention to 'Schoolhouse Rock!' when they talked about how a bill works,"" Bailey said. Bailey also worries about the potential for different states passing different laws that regulate online privacy in ways that could impact small businesses. Gaston County borders South Carolina, for example, and Bailey's restaurants have customers in both states. Bailey said both his restaurants use social media to reach potential customers -- usually with at least two posts a day. He's also able to use the platforms to post job openings. ""It's extremely important,"" he said. ""I don't know if I didn't have those platforms available to me that I would have opened a new restaurant. It's a tough market."" ___ (c)2019 Gaston Gazette, Gastonia, N.C. Visit Gaston Gazette, Gastonia, N.C. at www.gastongazette.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",science,CNN Business,left
'Every American is entitled to health care': Sen. Bernie Sanders,"The United States must end the international embarrassment of not guaranteeing health care as a right, Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., said ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday. Sanders spoke with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, days after the first Democratic presidential debates , where many of his progressive policies were front and center . His proposal for Medicare for all would dismantle President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, eliminate private insurance and create a single-payer program, in which all Americans would participate in a single, government-run plan that does not include deductibles and out-of-out pocket costs. Critics say Sanders' plan would dramatically increase taxes. Following his push for the policy in 2016, the policy has become a progressive litmus test for candidates this election cycle. During the debate on Thursday , the 10 candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would eliminate private insurance to implement Medicare for all. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was one of two candidates to raise her hand in favor of eliminating private insurance. The following morning she walked back her support of eliminating private insurance on MSNBC , saying that she had misunderstood the question and she would not eliminate private insurance in favor of Medicare for all, but does support Sanders' proposal for a single-payer government-run insurance plan. (MORE: Bernie Sanders details plan to cancel $1.6 trillion in student loan debt for everyone) Sanders' responded to Harris' backtracking Friday in a statement, writing that he ""demanded that all candidates be clear about their stance on Medicare for all."" ""If you support Medicare for all, you have to be willing to end the greed of the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries. That means boldly transforming our dysfunctional system by ending the use of private health insurance"" Sanders wrote. ""It is imperative that we remain steadfast in our commitment to guarantee health care as a human right and no longer private corporations to make billions of dollars in profits off Americans' health care.""

Because of New Hampshire and 21 other states that supported our agenda, other Democratic candidates now understand that they have got to talk to the needs of the working class of this country,"" he said.

Nurse comes to aid of Navy Pier stabbing victim: 'Security and I were trying to hold him down to get a tourniquet on him',"CHICAGO   A nurse from Minnesota came to Chicago a tourist but is going back a hero to her young sons after rushing to the aid of one of three people stabbed at Navy Pier. Not only did she apply a makeshift tourniquet on a badly slashed arm Thursday night, she kept her cool as panicked families ran past her, leaving strollers and blankets and even shoes. Then she calmed her 8- and 12-year-old sons when the man drew a knife before police grabbed him. On Friday, the boys couldn't stop talking about their mother as they continued seeing the sights of the city. ""They got excited,"" said the 32-year-old woman, who asked not be named. ""And today, they're still telling people what happened."" The woman said she had only been in Chicago once before, while in high school, but decided to visit this week with her sons after her boyfriend left for his annual motorcycle trip. After enjoying the fireworks show at Navy Pier Thursday, the three began heading back to their hotel. ""All of a sudden I hear, 'Oh my God!' "" she said. ""I turned to my right and there was this guy standing upright, waving his arms all around."" He wasn't saying much but his left arm was gushing blood. ""He was bleeding profusely. There was blood everywhere,"" she said. Police said the man was one of three people stabbed during a fight outside the pier about 10 p.m. The other two, 14-year-old boys, were not as seriously injured. First she made sure her sons were safely out of the way. ""I told them to stay put and don't move."" Then it was ""all on the situation at hand,"" the woman said. She quickly thought ""did I have a belt?"" In the chaos, she forgot if her sons were wearing belts. She asked and they said no. A man who also stopped to help ""had a piece of fabric or something that we could tie. (The victim) was swinging around, trying to move away from us, holding his arm. We were trying to get him to stop at least long enough to tie the makeshift tourniquet. "" They finally tied it and the man left. But the woman said she stayed with the victim. ""He was in and out of consciousness. He would lose it and then pop back up and fight security. Security and I were trying to hold him down to get a real tourniquet on him. Then I would check to make sure he'd not lose a pulse."" He briefly regained consciousness and stood up. ""He pulled a knife and one of the officers yelled, 'Knife!' and everybody started running away. My little one started crying. He thought I was going to get hurt. I just jumped out of the way."" She told her boys, ""Look, mom's standing right here. Police are between us. Mom's OK. We're all OK."" The officers had drawn their guns, according to police. The man dropped the knife and the officers handcuffed him. All this time people were running past. ""They were screaming … it was chaos."" A young woman passed out nearby. As the scene quieted down, police gave her sons honorary medallions from the SWAT team. ""The officers told the boys, 'You did a great job being brave.' … That was the coolest part."" The woman said she has worked at a hospital trauma center for about a year. ""It was instinct. It's not the first time I've stopped for an accident or anything. It's just, I don't know, second nature. You see somebody get hurt and you want to help."" The next day, the family carried on with their trip, visiting the Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium. ""They were still telling everyone about it,"" she said. After a visit to Starved Rock, they were heading home Sunday.     ©2019 Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",crime,Chicago Tribune,center
"dnr ended its frog and toad survey, but maplewood volunteers wouldn't quit","From a shrill chirp to a banjo-like strum, frog and toad calls are much more nuanced than the ""ribbit"" sound many children are taught. For years, Maplewood volunteers have listened and documented the variety of calls made by Minnesota's 14 species. But organized listening to the amphibians is decreasing. The state Department of Natural Resources discontinued its 23-year-old frog- and toad-calling survey in 2017. Maplewood volunteers refuse to quit, however, and are continuing to eavesdrop on the animals. In 2006, naturalist Carole Gernes surveyed Maplewood's wetlands, lakes and ponds. Gernes developed the four frog-monitor routes that volunteers use today. Locations on each route range from back yards to the edges of wetlands. LEARNING THE CALLS Volunteers continue to monitor Maplewood's frogs and toads, as they have done for 12 years. Claire and Mike Rohweder are among the volunteers this season. The Rohweders became Minnesota Master Naturalists in 2013. They then volunteered at the Maplewood Nature Center, where they were introduced to the monitoring program. ""We jumped on board with that,"" Mike Rohweder said. ""It sounded kind of fun."" The center conducts an annual refresher course to go over species that volunteers will hear and quiz them on their knowledge. There's also an online resource for newcomers to familiarize themselves with each call. ""I really like carefully observing the world around me, but I had no idea what a frog sounded like,"" Claire Rohweder said. After finishing her fifth season of monitoring, she now tells her nephews which frog species they've found based on the recordings they play for her. NIGHT LIFE Volunteers must document the air temperature, wind speed, moon visibility, passing vehicles and distracting noises on the route. At each of the 10 stops, volunteers must listen for five minutes, and record the frequency of the calls. If wind speeds reach 12 mph or rain is in the forecast, no surveys are conducted. This year, there were three periods when volunteers could conduct listening sessions: April 15-30, May 15-June 5 and June 25-July 10. Local volunteers submit data to the Nature Center, which is then studied by researchers. CREATING CHANGE This data aids efforts to research the city's water quality. For example, researchers noticed that frog calls in Knucklehead Lake were dropping. After that warning, the city installed a shoreline buffer to improve water quality in 2006. In another instance, volunteer data detected an issue at a pond near John Glenn Middle School.

Once the mowing ceased, native vegetation grew back and acted as a buffer to prevent soil, leaves and grass clippings from washing into the pond. It was a victory for the pond. According to Maplewood naturalist Gernes, the water went from ""pea soup without a peep"" to having plenty of frogs again.",legal arguments,The Washington Post,left
Denver rounding up Canada geese to feed the needy,"The city of Denver apparently has a new motto: Geese are not friends. They're food. Fed up with its growing goose problem, the city has implemented an initiative to round up its Canada geese and process them into food for ""needy families,"" US Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Suzanne Bond said. ""The resident goose population in this area is too large, which will cause many problems including overgrazing of grass, ornamental plants and agricultural crops; accumulation of droppings and feathers; disease, attacks on humans by aggressive birds; and the fouling of reservoirs, swimming areas, docks, lawns and recreational areas,"" Bond said. The USDA says goose meat is safe for human consumption. There are an estimated 5,000 geese living in the city, which has been trying to manage its goose population for more than 15 years. The city says the birds have led to ""increased human-wildlife conflicts in parks, vegetation destruction, sanitation concerns, poor water quality, and other maintenance challenges."" ""We get so many complaints about people coming out here with a blanket to sit on the grass, and they cannot sit on the grass because there's so much goose poop in the parks,"" Scott Gilmore, deputy executive director of Denver Parks and Recreation, told CNN affiliate KDVR. The program started this month because the geese are at their most vulnerable: They molt around June and July and can't fly. The USDA will conduct the roundups and help regulate whether the meat is suitable for human consumption, Denver Parks and Recreation said. The agencies hope to donate the meat to ""charitable organizations and wildlife rehabilitation facilities."" Canada geese are protected under the Migratory Bird Act , but Denver Parks and Recreation obtained authorization from both the state and federal governments to manage the population via roundups, according to its website. Denver has tried other goose management tactics including oiling their eggs, spraying repellents and creating visual barriers to discourage geese from nesting.",environmental issues,CNN,left
Two former state senators found dead in their homes within two days,"Two former state senators were found dead in their homes in Arkansas and Oklahoma within a span of two days this week. In Arkansas, the body of former Republican state Sen. Linda Collins-Smith was found Tuesday in her home in Randolph County. She'd been fatally shot and her death is being investigated as a homicide, CNN affiliate KARK reported. Collins-Smith, who was a Democrat before switching to the Republican Party, was first elected to the state senate in 2014 and lost her party's primary last year, the affiliate said. ""She was a passionate voice for her people and a close member of our Republican family. We are praying for her loved ones during this difficult time,"" the Arkansas GOP tweeted. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was stunned by her death and expressed his condolences to her loved ones. ""She was a good person who served in the public arena with passion and conviction.

Jonathan Nichols' body was in his home in Norman -- about 20 miles from Oklahoma City. He served as state senator from 2000 to 2012, and later worked at the University of Oklahoma, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. Authorities confirmed his death Thursday. ""Investigators are currently working with the Oklahoma medical examiner's office to determine the exact cause and manner of death,"" the Norman Police Department said. Lawmakers expressed shock over his death. ""Senator Jonathan Nichols was the most brilliant political, legal mind in the Oklahoma State Legislature, and worked tirelessly as a senator and for years on staff to help guide our state forward,"" said Sen.

These Frenchmen Are Building an Epic Medieval Castle,"Years ago, my husband began dragging me to European castles . Like so many others, he has a thing for medieval keeps, moats and dungeons. More than 1,000 of them were built a century after the Norman Conquest alone, many of which still stand   some occupied, some mere remnants. What's missing from all of these symbols of former aristocratic glory is a pulse   a community filled with decadence, despair, determination, decorum or even debauchery. But deep in the heart of the French countryside, I found a medieval castle teeming with life. When my husband and I arrived, the men on-site were drenched in sweat as they stood back to admire their handiwork. Clad in linen tunics cinched with rope and leather belts, they used a wooden triangle and plumb line to ensure the wall they were building was straight. Eschewing modern tools like drills, levels and electricity, these workers are part of a decades-long project to build France's first authentically made medieval castle in the modern era. With the very people [that] society was throwing on the scrap heap … I could build a castle. Maryline Martin, CEO Named after the surrounding forest, Guédelon castle is a two-hour drive south of Paris. The concept was inspired by a late-1990s archaeological survey that revealed a medieval fortress once stood within the walls of nearby Saint-Fargeau castle. Saint-Fargeau's owner, Michel Guyot, suggested to Maryline Martin   Guédelon's CEO   that it would be interesting to build ""a castle from scratch."" This led to the first stone being laid in 1997, on the site of an abandoned quarry, the start of a 25-year process of learning the art of castle-making. For Martin, it was also a chance to supply the local community with an interesting sight, and jobs. ""For me, Guédelon is an act of provocation,"" she says, pointing to her work with a group of long-term unemployed people to show that ""with the very people [that] society was throwing on the scrap heap … I could build a castle."" The laborers have resurrected ancient building techniques, turning this provocation into plinths, plaster and parapets. The result is a growing example of a 13th-century enclosure castle, with four walls, four corner towers, a great hall and a gatehouse. Masons cut the locally quarried stone, while a 70-strong team builds the structure using only medieval-style implements and methods. Visitors, meanwhile, get to watch the action, learning how quarrymen, stonemasons, woodcutters, carpenters, blacksmiths, tile-makers, carters and rope-makers worked in the Middle Ages. This revival of ancient handicraft ""is experimental archaeology in action,"" says Sarah Preston, Guédelon's press officer. The castle-under-construction draws 300,000 visitors a year   tickets cost 12 euros for adults and 10 euros for children   and tourists can enjoy stone carving and clay workshops, as well as occasional theme days featuring smelting, lime burning, bread baking or wood turning. Those looking to really get their hands dirty can take classes and join the site for three to seven days to help with construction. And after the last tapestry is hung? The site will remain dedicated to experimental archaeology projects, such as medieval houses, says Preston: ""Guédelon is a never-ending venture.""",science,CNN,left
Deportation raids not happening in Twin Cities,"President Trump says plans for mass raids on undocumented people are delayed because Democrats asked for it. But NBC News is reporting that two Department of Homeland Security officials told the network -- the raids were delayed because the plan had been leaked to the media. And because ICE did not have plans in place for detaining the immigrants they were going to arrest and deport. Mayors of the Twin Cities said they would not cooperate if any raids were held here. And attorney Ana Pottratz Acosta says they don't have to cooperate. Acosta says this is consistent with policies that have existed in Minneapolis and St. Paul for several years. ""Under the 10th amendment there is separation of powers between the federal government and local government for not following certain rules. Really the only thing that the feds can do is withhold funding in a very narrow sense,"" she said. ""If there is any funding they try to withhold it has to be directly related to the action taken by the state or local government."" Pottratz Acosta is a professor with Mitchell Hamline School of Law who specializes in immigration. ""For example, Hennepin county does not honor something called a detainer, where ICE asks them to continue holding someone in custody in a county jail so that they can be arrested by ICE,"" she said. ""One of the main reasons why they have this policy is because they don't want to expose cities to any liabilities. So, Let's say Minneapolis or St. Paul Police assist with ICE in enforcement, and something goes wrong and they arrest the wrong person and hold a U.S. Citizen in custody, the cities could face liability for that."" She encouraged families who may be impacted to remember their rights. ""I think the most important thing to remember is that you do have rights. If you do have a final order of removal that hasn't been executed yet you should probably talk to an attorney as soon as possible,"" she said.",legal arguments,NBC News,left
David E. Kelley's 'Lincoln Lawyer' TV series in the works at CBS,"David E. Kelley 's coming back to CBS.

CBS has made a series production commitment to ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" meaning the network will have to pay Kelley and his creative team a sizable fee if it later chooses not to green light the series, which is now in development. Like the novel and 2011 film with Matthew McConaughey , ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" will focus on an unconventional legal crusader named Mickey Haller, who runs his Los Angeles law practice out of the back of a Lincoln town car. Kelley   a Maine native who made his name with hits like ""L.A. Law,"" ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" and ""Chicago Hope""   three years ago told the Television Critics Association's summer press tour that he was done with broadcast television. He criticized the ""burden"" on writers ""of constantly having to bring your viewers up to speed in case they missed that last episode."" At the time, Kelley was promoting ""Goliath"" for Amazon. In the years since, he's become a power player beyond broadcast, creating ""Big Little Lies"" for HBO. Kelley is also behind upcoming HBO miniseries ""The Undoing,"" which will reteam him with ""Big Little Lies"" star Nicole Kidman . Still, with networks like CBS ordering ambitious projects toplined by A-list actors to compete with offerings from premium cable and streaming giants like Netflix, Kelley won't be coming back to the same broadcast space he left.

U.S. man accused of N.Korean embassy theft in Madrid to be freed on bail,"LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. man accused of taking part in a raid on the North Korean Embassy in Madrid was ordered freed on $1.3 million bail on Tuesday but must serve home confinement ahead of his possible extradition to Spain. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jean Rosenbluth, at a hearing in Los Angeles, warned Christopher Ahn, 38, that family members or close friends who posted bail for him could lose their money or property and face contempt of court charges if he fled. ""I spent a lot of time reading about you and I'm confident you're going to do the right thing,"" Rosenbluth told Ahn, who had several family members in attendance at the hearing. The judge told Ahn, who lives in Chino Hills east of Los Angeles, he was to wear an ankle monitor and remain at home except for medical appointments and church. Spanish authorities have charged Ahn with being among at least six individuals who entered the North Korean mission on Feb. 22 in Madrid, beat some embassy personnel, held them hostage for hours and then fled. The intruders removed computers, computer drives and a mobile phone from the embassy, according to U.S. court documents. The charges Ahn faces in Spain include breaking and entering, robbery with violence and causing injuries, according to U.S. court documents. At least two of the individuals charged in Spain remain at large, including Adrian Hong, a Mexican national and longtime U.S. resident and activist who is said to have led the group. Spanish investigators identified the intruders as members of a group called Cheollima Civil Defense, or Free Joseon, that seeks the overthrow of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 'UNDERGROUND RAILROAD' An attorney for Ahn has acknowledged he was part of an ""underground railroad"" that helped at least one person and his family flee North Korean authorities, according to U.S. court documents. The term underground railroad most commonly refers to a network of secret routes and safe houses that African-American slaves used to seek freedom in the 19th century. Rosenbluth mentioned concerns about an ""underground railroad"" at the hearing on Tuesday, as she crafted conditions of Ahn's release - such as not contacting Hong - which she said were intended to keep him from fleeing. Ahn was expected to be released from custody in the coming days after bail is posted, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. Ahn, who joined the U.S. Marines at 24 and served for six years, was not in the military at the time of the incident at the embassy. ""It's like a huge weight has been lifted off of our shoulders knowing that he's going to be home, he's going to be with loved ones, we can visit with him now,"" Juan Sanabria, 35, a former Marine who served with Ahn in Iraq said outside court. U.S. agents arrested Ahn on April 18 in Los Angeles, and his attorneys have sought his release from custody since then.

The 10 most attractive employers for engineering students,"According to a recent analysis of data from the American Community Survey by Zippia , five of the top 10 highest-paying college majors fall into the engineering category   so students graduating with an engineering degree are in a great position. Petroleum engineering, engineering mechanics and physics, naval architecture and marine engineering, mining and mineral engineering and chemical engineering all cracked the list of the highest-paying college majors with average annual incomes between $79,086 (chemical engineering) and $169,680 (petroleum engineering). Salaries are particularly high for engineering majors because these skills are in high demand and in turn, employers much battle for top tech talent to recruit and retain workers with these kinds of educational backgrounds. Global research and advisory firm Universum surveyed 10,860 engineering majors about what companies they were most interested in. Here are the 10 most attractive employers for engineering students: 10. ExxonMobil Headquarters: Irving, Texas 9. Amazon Headquarters: Seattle, Washington 8. Microsoft Headquarters: Redmond, Washington 7. Apple Headquarters: Cupertino, California 6. Lockheed Martin Headquarters: Bethesda, Maryland 5. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters: Washington, D.C. 4. Boeing Headquarters: Chicago, Illinois 3. Google Headquarters: Mountain View, California 2. Tesla Headquarters: Palo Alto, California 1. SpaceX Headquarters: Hawthorne, California According to Universum, engineering majors anticipate starting salaries around $70,000, but at companies like these, many workers can expect to earn much more. SpaceX came out on top as the number one most attractive employer to engineering students with 20.93% of Gen Z respondents and 17.98% of Millennial respondents saying the aerospace company was their top choice. Other aerospace organizations also made the list of attractive employers, including Boeing and NASA. Universum's survey found that engineering majors were most interested in the aerospace and defense, energy and technology hardware and equipment industries and their top career goals include to have work-life balance, to have and to be dedicated to a cause or feel like they are serving the greater good.

The 10-foot-long, 30-pound mother   named Anna   gave birth to two babies that appear to be genetically identical to their mother, the New England Aquarium said, citing DNA testing. Anna has never been exposed to an adult male snake, the aquarium said. ""DNA testing has confirmed that the 2-foot-long, green anaconda youngsters are the product of nonsexual reproduction,"" a news release from the Boston aquarium said Thursday. ""The extremely rare reproductive strategy is called parthenogenesis, which translated from its Greek word origins means virgin birth."" Anna also gave birth to a number of stillborn babies, which is common when parthenogenesis occurs among creatures that are not insects or plants, the aquarium said. Three snakes were initially born alive, but one died soon after birth. Though the births were discovered in January, it took extensive investigation to confirm the snakes had been born via nonsexual reproduction. The baby snakes are not exhibited but get daily human interaction, the aquarium said. Although they are probably genetically identical, they have distinct personalities   one being more ""laid back"" and the other being ""more apt to explore and check out its surroundings by sniffing out items with its tongue,"" the aquarium said. Similar cases of nonsexual reproduction have been documented in lizards, sharks, birds and snakes, the aquarium said. In 2014, a United Kingdom zoo reported parthenogenesis in a green anaconda. Not all cases of parthenogenesis result in exact genetic clones of the mother. Parthenogenesis can occur in the wild, according to the aquarium. Reproducing in this manner is genetically ""vulnerable,"" aquarium spokesman Tony LaCasse told The Washington Post. ""It's among that tagline, life will find a way,"" LaCasse said. ""It's a completely unique and amazing reproductive strategy, but it has a low viability compared to sexual reproduction.""

He was 53. Luis Alvarez, who joined the NYPD in 1990 and became a top champion of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund year, had entered a hospice center a week after his emotional appearance before a House panel with former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart. ""We told him at the end that he had won this battle by the many lives he had touched by sharing his three-year battle,"" his family said in a statement announcing his death. ""He was at peace with that, surrounded by family."" On June 20, just days after Alvarez and Stewart appeared before Congress and garnered headlines about the 9/11 fund, Alvarez announced he was entering hospice care after complications related to colorectal cancer, which he was diagnosed with in 2016. The cancer spread and caused his liver to shut down.

Huge fossil discovery made in China,"Scientists say they have discovered a ""stunning"" trove of thousands of fossils on a river bank in China. The fossils are estimated to be about 518 million years old, and are particularly unusual because the soft body tissue of many creatures, including their skin, eyes, and internal organs, have been ""exquisitely"" well preserved. Palaeontologists have called the findings ""mind-blowing"" - especially because more than half the fossils are previously undiscovered species. The fossils, known as the Qingjiang biota, were collected near Danshui river in Hubei province. More than 20,000 specimens were collected, and a total of 4,351 have been analysed so far, including worms, jellyfish, sea anemones and algae. They will become a ""very important source in the study of the early origins of creatures"", one of the fieldwork leaders, Prof Xingliang Zhang from China's Northwest University, told the BBC. Details of the findings were published in the journal Science on Friday. The discovery is particularly remarkable because ""the majority of creatures are soft-bodied organisms like jellyfish and worms that normally stand no chance of becoming fossilised"", Prof Robert Gaines, a geologist who also took part in the study, said in an email to the BBC. The majority of fossils tend to be of hard-bodied animals, as harder substances, like bones, are less likely to rot and decompose. The Qingjiang biota must have been ""rapidly buried in sediment"" due to a storm, in order for soft tissues to be so well preserved, Prof Zhang says. Scientists are especially excited by the jellyfish and sea anemone fossils, which Prof Gaines describes as ""unlike anything I have ever seen. Their sheer abundance and their diversity of forms is stunning"". Meanwhile, palaeontologist Allison Daley, who was not part of the study but wrote an accompanying analysis in Science, told BBC's Science in Action programme the find was one of the most significant in the last 100 years. ""It blew my mind - as a palaeontologist I never thought I'd get to witness the discovery of such an incredible site. ""For the first time we're seeing preservation of jellyfish - [when] you think of jellyfish today, they're so soft-bodied, so delicate, but they're preserved unbelievably well at this site."" The research team are now documenting the remaining specimens, and conducting more drilling in the region to find out more about the ancient local ecosystem, and the fossilisation process. Prof Zhang says he looks forward to studying ""all these new species - I'm always excited when we get something new"". The fossils are from the Cambrian period, which began 541 million years ago and saw a rapid increase in animal diversity on Earth. Prof Gaines hopes his work will also strike a chord with modern readers. ""Biotic diversity today is something that we take for granted, even though there are indications that extinction rates are sharply increasing. ""Yet most of the major animal lineages were established in a singular event in the history of life, the Cambrian explosion, the likes of which have never been seen before or after. It also reminds us of our deep kinship to all living animals.""",science,BBC News,center
Just in time for Valentine's Day: Newly discovered dinosaur had heart-shaped tail,"There have been dinosaurs with feathers , ""baby dragon"" ones and even dinos that looked like ducks . Now, just in time for Valentine's Day, scientists say they've discovered a dinosaur that had a heart-shaped tail. Not just a novelty act, this new dinosaur   which scientist say wears its ""heart"" on its tail   provides new clues as to how ecosystems evolved in Africa, a new study suggests. The new dinosaur is ""a unique species and provides new insights into sauropod evolution,"" the study said. Sauropods were the largest land animals in Earth's history. Other well-know sauropods include Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus. This dinosaur was given the scientific name of Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia, which derives from the Swahili words meaning ""beast of the Mtuka"" and ""heart of the tail,"" referring respectively to the location it was found and to the heart-shaped part of its tail vertebrae. Lead authors of the study are Eric Gorscak of Midwestern University in Illinois and Patrick O'Connor of Ohio University . The find shows a more complex picture of dinosaur evolution on Earth. O'Connor said that ""each new discovery adds a bit more detail to the picture of what ecosystems on continental Africa were like during the Cretaceous."" The Cretaceous spans from 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. Fossils of the creature's skeleton were discovered in southwestern Tanzania, high in a cliff wall overlooking the seasonally dry Mtuka riverbed. The new dinosaur is yet another member of the large, long-necked titanosaur sauropods. Titanosaurs were the most widespread group of sauropods, which reached their peak in the Late Cretaceous after all other sauropod groups vanished. However, scientists say their early evolution is poorly understood due to a lack of fossils in places other than South America. More: Looks like chicken? New feathered dinosaur discovered in China More: This duck-like dinosaur with killer claws ran, swam and tore prey to shreds ""Although titanosaurs became one of the most successful dinosaur groups before the infamous mass extinction capping the Age of Dinosaurs, their early evolutionary history remains obscure, and Mnyamawamtuka helps tell those beginnings, especially for their African side of the story,"" Gorscak said. Judy Skog of the National Science Foundation said ""this new dinosaur gives us important information about African fauna during a time of evolutionary change. It's also timely information about an animal with heart-shaped tail bones during this week of Valentine's Day.""

Police charge relative with quadruple family slayings,"CINCINNATI (AP)   The husband of one of the victims in an Ohio family slaying was arrested on murder charges, authorities said Tuesday. West Chester Township Police Chief Joel Herzog said that Gurpreet Singh, 37, was arrested in Connecticut and was in custody in New Haven County pending procedures to return him to Ohio to face four aggravated murder charges. He had called 911 on April 28 to say he found the four ""on the ground and bleeding"" in a West Chester, Ohio, apartment. Authorities didn't say why Singh, who is a truck driver, was in Connecticut. A township spokeswoman said she didn't know whether Singh has an attorney yet. Butler County Prosecutor Mike Gmoser declined to discuss details of the investigation, saying the case will be presented to a grand jury, which could help determine whether the suspect would face the death penalty upon conviction. ""There will be a day of reckoning in this case,"" Gmoser said. Authorities spoke at a podium with a poster showing the four victims and the message: ""Forever in our hearts."" The Butler County coroner said a man and three women died from gunshot wounds to the head. Singh was a resident of the apartment where they died. Members of a nearby Sikh temple said the four had worshipped there. Those killed were identified as: Shalinderjit Kaur, 39; Amarjit Kaur, 58; Parmjit Kaur, 62, and Hakiakat Singh Pannag, 59. Each had at least two gunshot wounds to the head. Singh had said, in the aftermath of the slayings, that he and Shalinderjit had been married 17 years and had three children. Family members identified Parmjit and Hakitakat as his wife's parents, and Amarjit as Parmjit's sister. Singh is a truck driver who told The Cincinnati Enquirer he was often away from home. Their three children were staying with other relatives at the time of the slayings and police said Tuesday they were safe but wouldn't say where they were. Police had said soon after the slayings that they didn't believe there was a threat to other community members. Investigators, including divers who searched a pond near the home, combed the apartment complex for clues. Such violent crime is rare in the township of some 62,000 people, roughly 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Cincinnati. Herzog assured residents after the slayings that authorities had no reason to believe that other community members were under threat. Herzog has attended services at the nearby Sikh temple where the family worshipped. Funeral services were held June 1 at a church in Mason, Ohio. News media reports at the time said family and friends came from India, Canada and other U.S. states for the services. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Gurpreet Singh is 37, not 36. ___ AP reporter Angie Wang in Cincinnati contributed.",crime,AP,center
US won't impose rule to protect against coal ash spill costs,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP)   The Trump administration said Tuesday that it won't require electric utilities to show they have money to clean up hazardous spills from power plants despite a history of toxic coal ash releases contaminating rivers and aquifers. Environmental Protection Agency officials said Tuesday that modern industry practices and recently enacted regulations are sufficient to shield taxpayers from potential cleanup costs. The finding comes after the EPA last year reversed a related proposal under President Barack Obama that would have imposed new financial requirements on the hardrock mining industry. In both cases, industry lobbyists pushed back against requirements that could have meant higher costs for companies. The Associated Press reported last year that major utilities across the nation have found evidence of groundwater contamination at landfills and ponds used for decades as dumping grounds for coal ash. Heightened levels of pollutants   including arsenic and radium in some cases   were documented at plants in numerous states, from Virginia and Montana to Alaska. Utilities and other companies in 2017 produced more than 111 million tons (101 million metric tons) of coal ash, primarily from burning the fuel for power generation, according to the American Coal Ash Association. Much of the ash is recycled or used for industrial purposes such as concrete additives, but huge volumes end up in long-term storage. Coal ash disposal went largely unregulated until a 2008 spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant in Kingston, Tennessee. A containment dike burst and flooding covered less than half a square mile (nearly 1.2 square kilometers), dumped waste into two nearby rivers, destroyed homes and brought national attention to the issue. In 2014, an estimated 39,000 tons (35,380 metric tons) of coal ash spewed into the Dan River after a drainage pipe running below a waste dump collapsed at a Duke Energy plant in Eden, North Carolina. The toxic sludge turned the river gray for more than 70 miles (112 kilometers). Those accidents helped spur new EPA regulations in 2015 that were intended to increase oversight of the industry. Under Trump, the EPA is in the process of revising the 2015 coal ash rules. Attorney Lisa Evans with the environmental group Earthjustice said that could undermine efforts to protect against pollution. ""EPA tried hard to justify this reckless outcome, but its reasoning will make sense only to the coal industry,"" Evans said. EPA officials did not respond to a request for an interview. They said in Tuesday's announcement that the new rules ""have materially reduced risk"" of future coal ash spills. The changes included additional monitoring requirements and new standards intended to prevent the failures of dikes that contain coal ash. ""EPA believes that the network of federal and state regulations creates a comprehensive framework that applies to prevent releases that could result in a need for future cleanup,"" the agency said. Other pollutants from the power industry, such as PCBs and asbestos, are being addressed through separate regulations, EPA officials said. Under a court order, the EPA has spent the past several years reviewing the extent to which the nation's most polluting industries cover cleanup costs. ___ Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP",environmental issues,Associated Press,center
u.s. epa air chief under ethics scrutiny resigns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bill Wehrum, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official in charge of revising power plant rules and revamping vehicle emission standards who came under scrutiny for ethics allegations, will step down in days, he said on Wednesday. Wehrum, the head for air and radiation at the agency and one of its top officials, told staff in an email he will resign on Sunday. He said he was proud of the administration's efforts ""due in part to the clear direction provided by the president and the dedication of Administrator (Andrew) Wheeler to accomplishing the agency's mission."" Wheeler said while he knew Wehrum would eventually step down, the departure date ""has still come too soon."" But he applauded Wehrum for finalizing last week the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) regulation, a replacement for the Obama administration's signature climate regulation that targeted carbon emissions from power plants. The change, part of the Trump administration policy to slash regulations and raise production of fossil fuels, was a boost to coal-fired plants. Wehrum and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have been working to finalize a massive rewrite of vehicle emissions standards to freeze fuel-efficiency requirements at 2020 levels. Wehrum said after testifying at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing last week that he expected it would be weeks before the proposal was submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget for final review. INVESTIGATIONS Ethics allegations have dogged Wehrum, a former lobbyist for energy interests. Democrats in Congress had asked the EPA's inspector general to review whether Wehrum and other officials helped to reverse the agency's position in a major enforcement action they say favored DTE Energy, a client of his former law firm, Hunton & Williams, now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. Jeff Lagda, a spokesman for the EPA Office of Inspector General, said the office is still reviewing requests to review the allegations. An EPA spokesman said on Wednesday Wehrum had provided ""general regulatory advice but   consistent with his ethical obligations   did not participate in particular matters where DTE is a party."" Democratic lawmakers also had launched an investigation about the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG), an organization of power companies with coal-fired plants that sought to loosen emissions rules that Wehrum had previously represented. That group dissolved in May due to heightened scrutiny. ""Much like UARG suddenly dissolving in the face of scrutiny, Wehrum is now suddenly leaving amidst investigations into his potential ethical misconduct   investigations that should, and will, continue,"" Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said in a release on Wednesday. The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ethics allegations and Wehrum's office referred questions to the agency's press office. Mandy Gunasekara, who had worked as Wehrum's deputy until February, told Reuters that while Wehrum was frustrated with the investigations of his industry links, he told her he had only planned to stay at EPA for about a year. She said he wanted to leave after completing the ACE power plant rule and several permitting reforms, and that other rules that are in progress, such as the vehicle emission rewrite, ""are in a really good position."" ""They have gotten through the biggest decision points. What remains is applying the methodology they agreed to and the overarching legal arguments,"" Gunasekara said, adding that revamped methane regulations also would be ready this summer. Chris Grundler, who currently serves as director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, will become director of the Office of Atmospheric Programs, which oversees the agency's climate change programs and other functions. He will be switching jobs with Sarah Dunham, who has held that role since 2011. Grundler has overseen the office working to address excess diesel emissions in vehicles, including the EPA's review of Volkswagen AG and Fiat Chrysler polluting vehicles. Anne Idsal, the principal deputy administrator, will replace Wehrum on an acting basis, Wheeler said in a statement.

"Supreme Court, in unanimous ruling, moves to limit state and local governments' power to impose fines and seize property","The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that the Constitution's prohibition on excessive fines applies to state and local governments, limiting their abilities to impose fines and seize property. Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today's most popular stories on The Washington Post Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on just her second day back on the bench after undergoing cancer surgery in December, announced the decision for the court, saying that the 8th Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause protects against government retribution. ""For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties,"" Ginsburg wrote. ""Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies . . . Even absent a political motive, fines may be employed in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence."" The court ruled in favor of Tyson Timbs of Marion, Ind., who had his $42,000 Land Rover seized after he was arrested for selling a couple hundred dollars' worth of heroin. He drew wide support from civil liberties organizations who want to limit civil forfeitures, which they say empower localities and law enforcement to seize property of someone suspected of a crime as a revenue stream. Some justices, too, had become worried about the state and local efforts. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a recent opinion that civil forfeitures have ""become widespread and highly profitable."" ""This system   where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use   has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses,"" Thomas wrote, referring to reporting by The Washington Post and the New Yorker. At oral argument, Timbs's lawyer said the case was a simple matter of ""constitutional housekeeping."" The Constitution's Bill of Rights protects against actions of the federal government. But the Supreme Court over time has applied it to state and local governments under the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment. In 2010, for instance, the court held that the Second Amendment applied to state and local government laws on gun control. The Eighth Amendment states: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" Two of those commands   regarding bail and cruel and unusual punishments   have been deemed to apply to state and local governments. But until now, the ban on excessive fines had not been. And the Indiana Supreme Court noted that when overturning a lower court's ruling that the actions taken against Timbs were excessive. Ginsburg's opinion makes clear that the clause applies, and that it is ""incorporated"" under the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. Justices Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch agreed with the outcome, but said they would have relied on a different part of the 14th Amendment. The case is Timbs v. Indiana.",legal arguments,The Washington Post,left
Biden criticizes Amazon for paying $0 in corporate taxes,"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday criticized online retail giant Amazon for paying nothing in corporate taxes last year, making him the latest presidential candidate to slam one of the most profitable companies over its effective tax rate of below zero. "" I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers,"" Biden tweeted. ""We need to reward work, not just wealth."" I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT - Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 13, 2019 A report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy earlier this year found that 60 Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, avoided paying any federal income taxes in 2018. Amazon, which had $11.2 billion in profits last year, has become a prime target for Democrats seeking to criticize corporate power, potentially anticompetitive practices and dangerous working conditions. The company has been accused of mistreating warehouse workers, and it's facing multiple lawsuits from former employees who said they were treated inhumanely at the facilities. Amazon has said it treats its workers fairly. Biden jumped into the fray earlier this week, slamming the company at a campaign stop in Iowa on Tuesday. ""I've got nothing against Amazon,"" Biden said . ""But they should pay a few taxes, you know what I mean? What happens? It's all you guys. No, I'm serious."" In a statement to The Hill, an Amazon spokesperson defended the company's record on taxes. ""Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""The government has designed corporate tax law to encourage businesses of all sizes to invest in the U.S. economy to drive growth and create jobs."" The spokesperson added that the company invested more than $50 billion and created 45,000 full-time, full-benefit jobs last year. Biden's remark that he has ""nothing against Amazon"" raised eyebrows, as it comes amid a furious backlash in Washington against the country's top tech giants. Lawmakers and advocates have accused Amazon of wielding its corporate power to the detriment of other companies and workers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called for the government to break up Amazon, criticizing the company for running an online retail store while also selling products on the platform. "" Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version,"" Warren wrote in a blog post laying out her plans to break up tech companies like Facebook and Google. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has taken Amazon to task over its working conditions, among other things. The company has also drawn the ire of President Trump, who has insulted CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. The president has accused the Post of being biased against him. Earlier this week, Trump accused Amazon of colluding with Democrats to ""discriminate"" against him. Updated at 12:35 p.m.",politics,The Hill,center
Is my building vulnerable in a big earthquake? Here's how to find out,"The Ridgecrest earthquakes didn't cause any notable damage in the Greater Los Angeles area. But the shaking did spur hundreds of thousands to ask that eternal question in earthquake country: How safe is my building? Major earthquakes in metropolitan areas of California have highlighted the vulnerabilities of certain types of buildings. Unreinforced masonry can crumble. Houses not bolted to foundations can slide. Brittle concrete towers can collapse, as can ""soft story"" apartment buildings. Government agencies , researchers and journalists have begun compiling inventories of some of the buildings that might be at risk. Here are some of the most vulnerable places, as compiled from The Times' archives: Soft-story apartments Los Angeles inspectors spent about two years developing a list of 13,500 so-called soft-story buildings that probably need seismic strengthening. These apartments, which feature flimsy first floors that often serve as parking spaces, became popular after World War II as Los Angeles was spreading north into the San Fernando Valley and west toward the ocean. But they've also proved to be vulnerable to violent shaking. Such buildings collapsed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, including one apartment building where 16 people died. Owners of each building have been put on notice, and a number of them already have begun the retrofitting process. The retrofits can cost as much as $130,000, which has sparked concerns from owners and residents feeling the pressure of rising rents and a housing crunch. SEARCH: Check out our database of vulnerable L.A. buildings by address SEARCH: San Francisco's soft-story buildings that are covered under the quake retrofit ordinance SEARCH: Santa Monica's list. SEARCH: West Hollywood's list. Concrete buildings A Times analysis found more than 1,000 older concrete buildings in Los Angeles and hundreds more throughout the county may be at risk of collapsing in a major earthquake. Despite their sturdy appearance, some of the buildings are vulnerable to the sideways movement of a major earthquake because they don't have enough steel reinforced bars to hold columns in place. University of California researchers estimate that about 75 of the nearly 1,500 buildings on the list could collapse in a large earthquake, exposing thousands to injury or death. Each building would need to be examined more closely and undergo extensive testing to gauge its vulnerability; some may be safe, some may turn out not to be concrete. Scientists stressed that the list is not 100% accurate and that they have not reached any conclusions about the safety or hazard posed by any of the 1,451 buildings. A separate group of scientists used public records, maps and street surveys to compile a list of nearly 1,500 concrete buildings constructed before 1976 in Los Angeles.

Liquefaction also can cause something called ""lateral spreading,"" in which the ground can slide down gentle slopes or toward the bank of a river while on top of a buried layer that acts like a liquid.

JoJo Siwa responds after her Claire's makeup set was recalled for testing positive for asbestos,"JoJo Siwa has responded to the news that one of her Claire's makeup kits was recalled after some batches tested positive for asbestos. The 16-year-old Nickelodeon star addressed the situation in a video titled ""My Makeup"" that was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday. In the video, Siwa tells her audience that safety is her and Nickelodeon's ""number one priority,"" and that those who bought the set will be able to get a refund. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories. On June 6, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tweeted a warning to its followers that one of JoJo Siwa's makeup kits from Claire's had been recalled after a batch of its products tested positive for asbestos. Now the 16-year-old Nickelodeon star has issued a statement in a new YouTube video titled, ""My Makeup."" In the video posted on Saturday, Siwa tells her audience that this video is ""about something a little bit more serious."" ""Recently it's been brought up to my attention that there has been a problem with one of my products in Claire's stores,"" she said. ""And I just want to let everyone know that no matter what, safety is myself and Nickelodeon's number one priority in everything."" She goes on to say to that she ""put [her] trust into other peoples' hands"" with the branding of the product, and that she and her team are working to make sure anyone who bought the product can get a full refund. ""We are working really, really, really hard to make sure that this product is recalled and off all shelves,"" she said. ""And also that anyone who has this product, you can get a refund no matter what it is, if it's used, if it's unused, you can get a full refund."" Siwa then thanks her fans for understanding the ""serious"" situation. ""I just want to let you guys know the situation and I hope you understand,"" she said. ""And I thank you for understanding because it is serious to me and it means a lot to me because it is my name and it is my brand and it is my face, quite literally."" The makeup set, which is identified in the FDA's tweet as Batch/Lot No. S180109, appears to contain an eye-shadow palette, two lip glosses, and two nail polishes inside a heart-shaped plastic pouch featuring the ""Dance Moms"" alum's logo. At the time of the tweet, a representative for Nickelodeon provided a statement to INSIDER saying that the company was working with Claire's on looking into the matter. ""We take safety very seriously and require our licensees to comply with all applicable laws and safety standards relating to licensed products,"" the representative said. ""We are reviewing this matter with Claire's in light of the advisory from the FDA."" This isn't the first time Claire's has faced problems with asbestos this year. The FDA previously issued a warning in March 2019 after several of the brand's makeup items including an eye-shadow palette and compact powder were found to be contaminated with asbestos fibers. According to the FDA, asbestos is ""a naturally occurring mineral that is often found near talc"" and is a known carcinogen with many health risks. Asbestos can make its way into beauty products if the talc is not sourced carefully in the mining process. As INSIDER's Hilary Bruek noted in an article from March 2019, the FDA barely regulates the US cosmetics market. In fact, as Bruek pointed out, the US has prohibited 11 chemicals from cosmetics products - the list does not include asbestos - and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the law that regulates makeup products), has stayed the same since its inception in 1938, giving makeup manufacturers freedom to use many ingredients that come with potential health risks.

Ex-Arizona lawmaker sentenced in fatal Alaska shooting,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP)   A former Arizona lawmaker convicted in the shooting death of a man at a remote cabin site in Alaska is 2016 was sentenced Monday to 65 years in prison, with 20 years suspended. Mark Desimone showed little expression as he was sentenced. A jury last year convicted him of first-degree murder in the death of Duilio Antonio ""Tony"" Rosales during a hunting and fishing trip. Rosales' widow, Maria Gonzalez, tearfully pleaded with Desimone for answers Monday. ""Please, I'm begging you, just tell me why you did it,"" she said. During a statement, Desimone said something being an accident does not preclude fault. He apologized and said he took responsibility. At trial, Desimone's attorney, Deborah Macaulay, did not dispute Desimone fatally shot Rosales but suggested it was an accident and called the lack of a motive a hole in the prosecution's case. Superior Court Judge Philip Pallenberg said even if one accepts the defense's theory, it leaves the question of why was the gun pointed at the back of Rosales' head at close range, ""when it went off accidentally, twice."" He called it a mystery. ""I think the most likely sequence of events is some kind of a bizarre, impulsive act, motivated by who-knows-what,"" Pallenberg said later. There was no indication of a longstanding grievance ""that would have caused Mr. Desimone to plot Mr. Rosales' death,"" he said. The case calls for a sentence that is not at the bottom of the sentencing range and not at the top, he said. The state had asked for a sentence of 75 years, prosecutor Amy Paige said. Pallenberg called Rosales' death an incalculable loss to his family and others who knew him, saying Rosales touched many people during his life. Pallenberg said he got letters from people who had good things to say about Desimone, who he said ran a business and was involved in public life but also faced struggles. Desimone resigned from the Arizona House in 2008, during his first term, after being arrested in a domestic dispute with his then-wife. That case later was dropped.",crime,AP,center

Spontaneous Car Fire Creates Terrifying Moment For Mom,"CHICAGO (CBS)   Imagine driving home with your toddler strapped in the back of the family car. All of a sudden, you smell smoke, then see flames. It was a terrifying few moments for a northwest suburban mom. On Friday morning, Helen Barajas left an Arlington Heights park when her car ""blew up in flames"". ""The fire was coming fast and furious,"" she said. ""Kind of like haze coming out of the air conditioning vents."" Her 2-year-old son was strapped into a car seat in the back. ""My first thought is when I saw the flames was to get my son out of the car,"" Barajas said. But, the light smoke quickly intensified, and Barajas needed to get out with her son. ""Once I got to that corner, there were flames coming out of the bottom of the passenger side where the glove compartment was,"" she said. Neighbor Diane Rukstales called 911 and recorded video on her cell phone. ""The car burst into flames and then it kind of escalated,"" she said. ""I was sitting out in my backyard, and then I heard a child's voice yelling 'mama, mama, mama.'"" Barajas and her son narrowly escaped and were forced to watch as firefighters put out the flames. She is warning other drivers to be aware that this could happen. The fire was put out in minutes. A shell of twisted metal is all that's left, pieces of the charred car still on the street. Barajas said she hasn't had any problems with the car in the five years she's had it. But, she says it could have been a lot worse. The 2014 Acura MDX has six open recalls, but none come with a risk of spontaneous fire. Barajas says she plans on calling Acura to try and find out what happened.",environmental issues,CBS,left
Trump Rules Out Scaramucci as He Considers Next Press Secretary,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he hasn't decided who will replace Sarah Huckabee Sanders as White House press secretary but that it won't be his former communications director, financier Anthony Scaramucci. ""I like Anthony,"" who is known as the Mooch, but ""he should stay where he is right now,"" Trump said in a phone interview with Fox News on Friday. The president announced on Thursday that Sanders would resign at the end of the month. After his exit as White House communications director in August 2017, a post he held for 11 days before being fired, Scaramucci launched a Twitter account, The Scaramucci Post; did a stint on the TV show ""Celebrity Big Brother"" and now co-hosts the ""Mooch and the Mrs."" podcast with his wife. He is the founder and co-managing partner of the hedge fund SkyBridge Capital. Trump was non-committal about whether he would consider his wife's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, for the job. Grisham, who was part of Trump's 2016 campaign and then the White House press team, is ""terrific,"" he said, adding: ""We have a lot of great people."" Sanders's deputy, Hogan Gidley, is poised to step into the role at least temporarily if a permanent replacement isn't named by July. Trump has previously filled government spokesmen positions with Fox News personalities and may again turn to the network. The very nature of the press secretary position is in question after Trump's White House all but ended the tradition of daily press briefings. Sanders's turbulent tenure was marked by attacks on the media and the dissemination of false information. Trump has publicly encouraged Sanders, 36, to run for governor of her native Arkansas. The current governor, Republican Asa Hutchinson, was re-elected to a second term in 2018 and can't run again in 2022.

diplomats shaken for now after britain's us ambassador quits,"WASHINGTON (AP)   The abrupt resignation of Britain's ambassador to the United States over leaked cables critical of the Trump administration may have jolted official Washington, but it's unlikely to have a lasting impact on the U.S.-British relationship or diplomatic practice. Current and former diplomats say the leak of Ambassador Kim Darroch's sensitive reports is unfortunate and alarming, particularly given the apparent political motive behind it. Yet, they believe any complications will be temporary even as they create short-term turbulence in relations. ""It's a problem, but I don't know that it has a chilling affect over time because in the end people have jobs to do and they do their jobs,"" said Ronald Neumann, a retired three-time U.S. ambassador who is the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy. ""It's wrong and it's too bad. Still, you move on because there's work to be done."" Darroch, a well-known figure in Washington, resigned on Wednesday amid an uproar over the candid cables, saying ""the current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like."" The resignation followed President Donald Trump's furious caustic response to the leaked cables in which Darroch offered candid negative views of his administration. In the cables, Darroch called the administration's policy toward Iran ""incoherent,"" said the president might be indebted to ""dodgy Russians"" and raised doubts about whether the White House ""will ever look competent."" Trump's lambasting of Darroch on Twitter   he called the ambassador ""a pompous fool"" and ""a very stupid guy"" and criticized outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May   drew condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is in the running to replace May, replied: ""Allies need to treat each other with respect."" Others suggested that Trump's reaction proved Darroch's point. ""Trump's petty and vindictive overreaction not only reinforces the accuracy of Darroch's portrait of him in his leaked cables, but further erodes an already complicated bilateral relationship,"" said William Burns, a highly respected retired career diplomat who served as deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The State Department downplayed the fracas, saying: ""The United States and the United Kingdom share a bond that is bigger than any individual, and we look forward to continuing that partnership. We remain committed to the U.S.-UK Special Relationship and our shared global agenda."" But Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House intelligence committee, said Trump's comments make the work of American diplomats abroad harder than they already are. ""Diplomats the world over, including ours, are expected to provide candid assessments and advice to their home governments,"" he said. ""If a foreign leader treated an American ambassador as President Trump treated the British ambassador, we would be up in arms, and justifiably so. "" In fact, U.S. diplomats have already felt the consequences of leaked cables that laid out unvarnished and often unflattering impressions of foreign leaders and governments. The 2010 publication by WikiLeaks of tens of thousands of classified and sensitive documents had a direct impact on at least three U.S. ambassadors, including one, Carlos Pascual, who resigned as envoy to Mexico over fallout from cables critical of then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Pascual was traveling Wednesday and not immediately available to comment on any similarities between his resignation and Darroch's. Carnegie's Burns, who was serving as the third-ranking U.S. diplomat at the time, recalled that the leaks had ""negative practical implications"" for the day-to-day conduct of embassies. ""The immediate impact was to make U.S. diplomatic missions more careful, so there is, at least initially, a dampening effect,"" he said. ""But, we got over it in time."" In the long run, though, few believe damage to the ""special relationship"" caused this week will be severe or lingering. ""The state-to-state relationship is much more than one person, particularly with Britain,"" Neumann said. ""This is probably one of the least ambassador-dependent relationships we have, which is why we are able to send whoever we want to London, including some who are not so able.""",science,Business Insider,center
Foxconn says it can build enough iPhones outside of China to meet US demand: Report,"A Foxconn executive told Bloomberg that it can build enough iPhones to meet Apple's U.S demand. Apple is expected to launch new iPhones in September, and increased tariffs on products built in China could mean more expensive devices if Apple doesn't eat the fees itself. Foxconn said 25% of its iPhone production capacity is outside of China. Foxconn, which builds most of Apple's iPhones and iPads in China, told Bloomberg recently that it has the capacity to build enough iPhones outside of China to satisfy demand. U.S. President Donald Trump said last Thursday that he could raise Chinese tariffs by another $300 billion . Apple's new iPhones are expected to launch in September, when new models typically hit the market, and any increase in tariffs could potentially mean more expensive iPhones. Consumers have shown they're less willing to upgrade to pricier devices . ""Twenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we can help Apple respond to its needs in the U.S. market,"" said Foxconn executive Young Liu, according to Bloomberg. ""We have enough capacity to meet Apple's demand."" Apple no longer discloses how many iPhones it sells each quarter, but in February of 2018 Counterpoint Research said a record 22 million devices were sold during the fourth quarter of 2017, a bulk of the 51.2 million units Apple sold during that quarter worldwide. Foxconn was said to begin manufacturing some of its high-end iPhones in India this year and, according to Bloomberg, has started to begin ""quality tests for the iPhone XR,"" in the country. The iPhone XR is Apple's more affordable version of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, all three of which were launched last September. In May, J.P. Morgan said Apple would need to increase the cost of the iPhone by 14% to offset the costs of the current tariffs, unless it absorbs the costs itself. Bank of America estimated a 20% increase if Apple chose to move manufacturing to the United States. Apple CEO Tim Cook said last Tuesday that ""the Chinese have not targeted Apple at all"" in regards to tariffs on U.S. goods into China. Such tariffs could increase the cost of the iPhone to Chinese consumers, an increasingly important market for Apple. Read more on Bloomberg . Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",politics,Bloomberg,center
"Former Florida deputy, 26, arrested for routinely 'stopping drivers for minor traffic violations, planting drugs in their vehicles and then arresting them'","A former sheriff's deputy in Florida was arrested Wednesday accused of routinely pulling over drivers for minor traffic infractions, planting drugs and then arresting them on made-up drug charges. Former Jackson County deputy Zachary Wester, 26, was arrested in Crawford, Florida after a nearly year-long investigation, according to a statement from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). FDLE began its investigation last August at the request of Jackson County Sheriff's Office. It found that Wester routinely pulled over citizens for alleged minor traffic infractions, planted drugs inside their vehicles and arrested them on fabricated drug charges. He also circumvented JCSO's body camera policy and tailored his recordings to conceal his criminal activity. Authorities began investigating him after noticing his name as arresting officer on a disproportionate number of drug arrests. Christina Pumphrey, a former assistant state attorney in Marianna who was involved in the case, was reported as being concerned that his vehicle searches were not always conducted legally, and his written affidavits did not always match what she would watch in video footage. 'There is no question that Wester's crimes were deliberate and that his actions put innocent people in jail,' Chris Williams, an assistant special agent in charge for the FDLE in Pensacola, said in a statement. 'I would like to thank the citizens of Jackson County for their patience during the investigation and my staff for continuing to serve our citizens during this difficult time,"" said Jackson County Sheriff Lou Roberts. 'I also appreciate FDLE and the State Attorney's Office for their commitment to this investigation.' Wester faces felony charges of racketeering, official misconduct, fabricating evidence, possession of a controlled substance and false imprisonment. Charges in more than 100 cases stemming from arrests by a Jackson County Sheriffs Deputy were dropped, Associated Press reported. He is also charged with misdemeanor perjury, possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Wester was hired in May 2016 and worked as a patrol deputy. He worked as a Liberty County Sheriff's Office deputy from August 2015 until he joined JCSO. He was fired from The Sheriff's Office on September 10 for violating agency policy, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. During the investigation, FDLE agents analyzed over 1,300 minutes of recorded video and logged over 1,400 working hours on the case. Wester was booked into the Wakulla County Jail and is being held without bond. The Office of the State Attorney, First Judicial Circuit, will prosecute the case, which authorities said remains active. The Tallahassee Democrat reported in September 2018 that charges in at least two dozen cases were dropped, but authorities claimed at the time that the case against Wester was not over. Christina Pumphrey told the Tallahasee Democrat that she was 'incredibly surprised' to learn of his arrest because she didn't think he'd ever get charged. She said: 'I'm glad he's off the road. I'm glad he's obviously facing charges. It doesn't change what the rest of the people went through because of him. 'It doesn't give them their time back. It doesn't give them their money back. It doesn't expunge their records   they still have at least arrest histories. But it's still something.' Authorities are expected to release more details about the case at a conference on Wednesday afternoon. Body camera footage was also released from the arrest of Teresa Odom on charges including possession of meth in September 2018. Odom pleaded no contest to the charges and she was sentenced to four years of probation. However, her sentence was vacated in September. She filed notice in November 2018 of her intent to sue the Sheriff's Office, according to the Tallahassee Democrat . Prosecutors also dropped charges in September 2018 against Monica Willis, who was arrested by Wester on March 28 after a traffic stop. His arrest report stated that he found two silver colored spoons in her purse along with a baggie that field-tested positive for meth. She said she was two weeks pregnant at the time of the arrest, Wester noted, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Read more",legal arguments,Tallahassee Democrat,center
Cops found the pit bull 'on death's door.' His owner is in jail for animal cruelty,"A Sunrise woman was arrested and charged with animal cruelty on Saturday after police officers responded to an anonymous tip and found a starving, 2-year-old pit bull in a small cage, covered in ""eight piles of loose, diarrhea-like feces,"" according to an arrest report provided by the Sunrise Police Department. The dog's owner, Lisamarie Charles, 38, was arrested and charged with animal cruelty, a third-degree felony that can result in up to five years in prison or a fine of up to $10,000 or both. Charles was taken to the Broward main jail. When officers entered Charles' apartment in the evening on June 15, they were struck by an overwhelming odor of urine and feces, according to the arrest report. They found the dog - named Eshu - in a tiny cage that did not allow the animal to stand fully upright. From the cage, the animal had no access to food or water and his bones were visible through his skin. The dog was bleeding from both the nose and tail, according to the report. Amy Roman, owner of 100+ Abandoned Dogs of the Everglades, the animal rescue organization that received the original tip about the alleged abuse, told police the pit bull appeared to be ""on death's door."" According to the arrest report, ""the animal was subjected to a long period of repeated malnutrition and mistreatment"" that resulted in ""unjustifiable pain and suffering."" The treatment could have resulted in the death of the animal, according to the Sunrise Police Department's statement on the arrest. The pit bull has renamed ""McCarthy,"" after Officer Colleen McCarthy the police office who rescued him, and is under the care of 100+ Abandoned Dogs of the Everglades, according to the statement. ___ (c)2019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",crime,Miami Herald,left
man arrested in connection to wife's disappearance 'not the person portrayed in the media',"FARMINGTON, CT (WFSB) - An official who represents a Greek water skiing federation connected to the estranged husband of a missing woman issued a statement about the case on Monday. Nancy Mastrocosta, secretary general of the Hellenic Waterski and Wakeboard Federation, called Fotis Dulos a loving father. Read the entire statement here . Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend Michelle Troconis, face tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution charges in connection with the disappearance of Jennifer Dulos of New Canaan. Mastrocosta said Fotis Dulos and his children competed in the Greek Waterski Nationals between 2013 and 2016 in Lake Stratos, Agrinio. It was there she said she was able to meet Fotis Dulos and the children, but not Jennifer Dulos. ""Fotis Dulos is not the person portrayed in the media. Far from it,"" Mastrocosta said. ""We witnessed Fotis for many years as a calm, balanced, respectful, kind person. We witnessed a caring father, not only for his kids' skiing activities, but for every aspect of their daily lives, feeding them, putting them to sleep, taking his children and sometimes other children to different activities, such as swimming, bowling, dinner, etc. No one ever witnessed Fotis abusing his children in any way or form, or even forcing the children to ski. On the contrary, we repeatedly witnessed Fotis being a great father. It was Fotis who was present, not only in tournaments but also in practice. Coaching them and supporting them emotionally when needed. Being an accomplished skier himself, he always emphasized the effort instead of the result. By taking the pressure away, the children performed exceptionally and this was largely to his credit. I cannot speak about Jennifer because she never attended in these four years, not once."" Mastrocosta argued that the children enjoyed their time water skiing, contrary to what was said in divorce records . The records said water skiing was a point of contention in the marriage of Fotis Dulos and Jennifer Dulos. In them, Jennifer Dulos called the training schedule dangerous and excessive. She also called Fotis Dulos ""obsessed with water skiing"" and said he insisted ""that the children must train to be world class water skiers."" ""The children did not ski for 11 hours, as mentioned in the press and court filings,"" Mastrocosta said. ""Slalom sets, which are primarily what the children engaged in, usually last 10-15 minutes. There is a time limit set by the Federation of 15 minutes per set. This is typical and it is my belief that the Avon Ski Club where the children practiced mostly, has a similar limit per ski set   a maximum of 15 minutes. The children took one, sometimes two, sets per day. Very rarely one of them would take three sets. So, they typically spent half hour on the water or less."" Police searched parts of Avon, including a pond with a water skiing club, for Jennifer Dulos. Mastrocosta said in 2017, the Dulos children declined an invitation to compete with the HWWF in Spain. She said they haven't competed since. ""It is our understanding that Jennifer does not want them to continue water-skiing,"" she said. ""We hope, for the sake of the children, that they will be eventually reunited with their father, extended family and friends, and that they will be given the opportunity to follow their hearts and practice what they love. We miss them dearly."" Jennifer Dulos has been missing since May 24. New Canaan police said they've received hundreds of tips and dozens of responses to requests for surveillance video in connection with the case. The department's chief also predicted that more charges would be filed . Anyone with information about her disappearance is asked to contact New Canaan police at 203-594-3544. Tips and info can also be emailed in to FindJenniferDulos@newcanaanct.gov . The department also created a website dedicated to finding Jennifer Dulos.

donald trump nicknames wife 'melania t' as he calls her the 'jackie o' of our time,"Melania Trump and Jackie Kennedy both exhibited a flair for fashion throughout their lives, but many don't agree with President Donald Trump 's comparison of the two former first ladies. While celebrating his 73rd birthday on Friday, Trump called in to Fox and Friends to give a wide-ranging interview that touched on many subjects including his recent ""foreign dirt' comments , Sarah Huckabee Handers' White House departure , and his proposed redesign for Air Force One. Trump has spoken repeatedly about his plans of painting the presidential plane red, white and blue, replacing the light blue and white design which has been in place since John F. Kennedy 's presidency, and was partly chosen by his wife Jackie. Earlier this week, he unveiled four new mockups for the redesign during an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos . ""I like the concept of red, white and blue,"" Trump said during the Fox and Friends interview. ""It'll look much better, actually. The baby blue doesn't fit with us."" ""People get used to something but   and it was Jackie O. and that's good, but we have our own Jackie O. today. It's called Melania. We'll call it Melania T,"" he added. ""People love her. She gets no credit from the media, but she gets credit from the people."" RELATED: McCain and Obama Trend as Twitter Trolls Trump on His 73rd Birthday   But Ivanka Pays Tribute However, the comparison didn't sit well with many social media users. One Twitter user used a pair of side-by-side photos to illustrate their displeasure , sharing an image of Jackie visiting a sick child in the hospital alongside a photo of Melania wearing a jacket with the words ""I Really Don't Care. Do U? "" on them while visiting migrant children last year. (The first lady has since explained the jacket was meant to tell the media to focus less on what she wore , and more on what she stood for). ""Jackie O visiting suffering children vs. Melania visiting suffering children,"" the Twitter user wrote. Another user added : ""She has been trying to emulate her in dressing. But that's about where the similarities end. You can never become Jackie, Melania. Except on Halloween."" Others also took offense to the way Trump referred to his wife in the interview by using the pronoun ""it."" ""A) 'It' refers to an object, a thing   not a human being,"" wrote one social media user. ""B) Melania is not fit to wipe the dust from the bottom of Jaqueline's shoes. She could never be & will never be a 'new Jackie O'."" RELATED VIDEO: Trump Says Kim Kardashian Will Be 'One of the Most Successful Lawyers' During Her White House Visit Trump's plans to repaint Air Force One have been met with plenty of criticism, with some pointing out the similarities between the proposed redesign and Trump's defunct airline Trump Shuttle, as well as congressional resistance. On Wednesday, the House Armed Services Committee voted that all changes to Air Force One's paint scheme and interior design would need congressional approval. The vote passed 31-26. The vote refers to the deal the Air Force struck with Boeing in July 2018, with plans to replace the old 747 plans with two new aircrafts by the end of 2024, according to USA Today .",environmental issues,Chicago Tribune,center
States removed 17 million voters from rolls in two years,"States removed the registration records of more than 17 million voters between the 2016 and the 2018 elections in accordance with federal law, according to a report released Thursday by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. That number represents about 2.5 million more voters than were removed from 2013 to 2014 under the National Voting Rights Act, which mandates that states allow increased voting and registration opportunities as well as maintain accurate and current voting rolls. Under the act, states removed voters for not voting, moving between voting districts, death, committing a disqualifying crime, or being judged mentally incapacitated. The biennial survey follows calls in recent years by Republican-led state governments for more aggressive implementation of list-maintenance techniques they say are meant to protect the integrity of elections. Voting rights advocates have argued the methods disproportionately affect Democratic voters and minorities without enough consideration for the possibility of inaccurate removals, leading to claims of voter suppression. Legal challenges over voter registration practices have broken out across the country, often splitting along partisan lines. In 2018, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled that Ohio did not violate federal laws in its voter list maintenance process . In the state, if a voter doesn't vote in two years, they are sent a confirmation notice. If the mail is returned as undeliverable, the voter may be removed from the rolls in a process known as ""voter caging."" Following the decision, at least a dozen other Republican-leaning states said they would adopt similar measures. According to the 2018 Election Administration and Voting Survey submitted by the Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government that supports state and local election officials, states reported more than half of the removals occurred because a voter didn't return a confirmation notice or because they moved out of the voting district. ""The greatest problems we see are that postcards in today's digital world are increasingly inefficient. In a world of junk mail those artifacts are often easily misplaced or inadvertently junked,"" said Gregory Miller, co-founder of the Open Source Election Technology Institute (OSET), a nonprofit that researches election technology. NBC News has collaborated with the OSET Institute since 2016 to monitor technology and voting issues around U.S. elections. ""In some cases, the postcards, even if discovered in a pile of mail, may have been sent with very little time to respond,"" Miller said. A report last year by the Brennan Center for Justice , a nonpartisan public policy and law institute, found four states had engaged in illegal purges, and another four had implemented purge rules it called ""unlawful."" ""When done correctly, purges ensure the voter rolls are accurate and up-to-date,"" the study's authors wrote . ""When done incorrectly, purges disenfranchise legitimate voters … causing confusion and delay at the polls."" Multiple investigations have been opened into allegations of voter fraud, and none has found any evidence of widespread issues.",legal arguments,NBC News,left
'It's just a shock that somebody did this in broad daylight': Dognapper snatches senior pooch from Prospect Park while owner's back was turned,"A Brooklyn woman turned her back on her precious pooch in Prospect Park   and that was enough for a heartless crook to snatch the elderly Chihuahua mix and run off. Jess Gary is desperate for the return of Fidel, a diminuitive doggo with a giant personality who weighs 15 pounds and is 15 years old. Gary was in the park with Fidel and her other Chihuahua mix, 10-year-old Tito, at 8 a.m. Saturday during off-leash hours, when dogs can roam the park without a leash. ""I heard my dog behind me yelp and when I turned, he was gone,"" Gary, 37, told the Daily News. Gary never saw the thief, but a nearby jogger did and chased him down 1st St. on the west side of the park. When the dognapper turned right onto 8th Ave., the jogger lost sight of him, she said. ""There's generally a lot of people there during that time and it's very populated,"" the Crown Heights resident told The News. ""It's just a shock that somebody did this in broad daylight."" Gary has been canvassing the neighborhood with flyers promising a $3,000 reward for information in the hope her beloved Fidel wasn't taken too far from home. She's also filed a police report. ""We're hoping that because he (the suspect) disappeared on 8th Avenue so quickly, that he ducked into a building and he lives in the neighborhood,"" she said. Gary, a creative director who moved to Brooklyn from Los Angeles five years ago, said she adopted Fidel when he was just three months old. Now he suffers from advanced arthritis, and she's worried he's not getting his daily dose of pain medication. ""I've had him for his entire life,"" she said. ""He's a little guy and he's only 15 pounds but he's a super senior. He's got tons of personality and he's much loved in the dog community."" The jogger who chased after the dognapper described him as a slender man in his 30s, with curly blond hair, Gary said. ""I just hope that whoever has him brings him home safely, no questions asked,"" she said. ""I just want to see him home."" So does Fidel's pal Tito. ""He really misses his buddy right now,"" Gary said.

"Apple is planning to release another iPhone that costs less than $1,000 this year. Here's what we know about it.","Apple is once again expected to release three new iPhones in the fall, including a new iPhone XR. Here's what we're expecting to see in 2019. Apple is expected to release three iPhones again this year, meaning we're likely to see a follow-up to the iPhone XR. The new iPhone XR will reportedly have a 6.1-inch LCD screen like the current version, but it's getting an upgrade to two cameras as opposed to one. It may also come in different color options, including new lavender and green shades. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Those who balk at the idea of shelling out $1,000 for a new iPhone will probably be in luck again this year, as Apple is expected to release a lower-cost version of its flagship iPhone again in 2019. Reports indicate Apple will follow last year's pattern and release three new iPhones this fall: two high-end models and a less expensive successor to the iPhone XR. The iPhone XR is the more affordable version of Apple's flagship smartphone that starts at $750, compared with the $1,000 iPhone XS and $1,100 iPhone XS Max. Unlike the more expensive models, the iPhone XR has one camera instead of two and features an LCD screen rather than an OLED display. From new color options to an upgraded camera, here's everything we're expecting to see from Apple's follow-up to the iPhone XR. A dual camera Apple's next-generation iPhone XR will get a dual-camera setup similar to the one found on the current iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal . That will likely make it better at zooming and capturing photos in portrait mode. A 6.1-inch LCD screen The next-generation iPhone XR may be catching up to its pricier siblings when it comes to camera quality. But it sounds like the new XR will still have an LCD screen just like this year's model, according to The Journal and reports from the TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by 9to5Mac . Apple's pricier iPhone XS and XS Max feature OLED screens, which generally offer better contrast and deeper blacks than LCD panels. Those who want an iPhone XR with an OLED screen will likely have to wait until 2020, Kuo also recently predicted . Otherwise, the new XR's screen will measure 6.1 inches diagonally, according to Kuo, making it the same size as the current model. New color options The iPhone XR already comes in a wide variety of colors, but Apple will reportedly introduce new options, including lavender and green this year. It looks like the next-generation iPhone XR will come in softer pastellike colors compared with the bright and bold offerings available now, according to a photo that Bloomberg's Mark Gurman posted on Twitter that he said appeared to show the upcoming color options. The Japanese blog Mac Otakara first reported on the new color choices. Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1128171288692838401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw And here's what appear to be your next-generation iPhone XR colors (lavender purple and green instead of blue and coral) as @idanbo reported earlier this week: https://t.co/KQQ6JKmZg9 pic.twitter.com/7k3WZC2ZUi A battery that's slightly bigger Apple will bump up the battery size for its 2019 iPhones to accommodate a new feature that will make it possible to charge other devices using your iPhone, according to a note from Kuo that 9to5Mac obtained. But while the iPhone XS and XS Max successors are expected to get fairly noticeable increases in battery size, the next iPhone XR's battery will be only up to 5% larger. Other features that are coming to the new iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max The next iPhone XR is expected to get other miscellaneous new features that are rumored to appear on the successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, too. These include a new processor, an improved Face ID camera, a sharper 12-megapixel selfie camera, and support for bilateral wireless charging - the aforementioned feature that lets you charge other gadgets with your iPhone.",science,Business Insider,center
"Rocket hits site of foreign oil firms in Iraq's Basra, three hurt","BASRA, Iraq, June 19 (Reuters) - A rocket struck the site of the residential and operations headquarters of several global major oil companies, including U.S. giant ExxonMobil, near Iraq's southern city of Basra early on Wednesday, wounding three people, Iraq's military said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. It came after two separate attacks in as many days on bases housing U.S. military personnel in Iraq, as tension rose between the United States and Iran. The rocket hit the Burjesia site west of the city, according to police and a statement released by the military. Police earlier said two Iraqi workers were wounded. The United States evacuated hundreds of diplomatic staff from its Baghdad embassy last month, citing unspecified threats from Iran against U.S. interests in neighboring Iraq, where Tehran supports some Shi'ite militias. Wednesday's incident came just as Exxon staff who were also evacuated after the diplomats' departure had begun to return to Basra. A security source said Exxon was evacuating 21 foreign staff immediately by plane to Dubai. Oil officials said operations including exports from southern Iraq were not affected by the incident. Other companies operating at the site include Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Italy's Eni SpA, the oil officials said. The rocket was a short-range Katyusha missile, the military said. Police said it landed 100 meters from the part of the site used as a residence and operations center by Exxon. Burjesia is near the Zubair oilfield operated by Eni. Washington has ramped up sanctions pressure on Iran in recent months and says it has sent additional forces to the region over tension with the Islamic Republic. It blames Tehran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. Tehran denies it was involved. Both sides say they do not want war, but analysts warn such incidents could escalate violence in the region.

"Michael Wolff's Claim of 'Draft Indictment' of Trump Doesn't Exist, Says Mueller's Office","Video by GeoBeats A spokesman for Robert Mueller has strongly denied a claim from Fire And Fury author Michael Wolff that the special counsel drew up a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against Donald Trump before deciding to ditch it. The unverified allegation is made in Wolff's new book, Siege: Trump Under Fire , which is due to be published next week. It's the sequel to Fire and Fury , which infuriated the president for its claims about the dysfunctional inner workings of his White House. The Guardian obtained a copy of the new book and reports that Wolff states his findings about Mueller's supposed draft indictment are ""based on internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel."" The newspaper writes that it's seen the documents. However, Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, told the newspaper: ""The documents that you've described do not exist."" Wolff claims the draft of the president's alleged abuses was written under the title ""United States of America against Donald J. Trump, Defendant,"" and it sat on Mueller's desk for a year before being discarded. The Guardian reports the first of the three counts charged the president with corruptly influencing, obstructing or impeding a pending proceeding before a department or agency. The second count is said to have charged the president with tampering with a witness, victim or informant, while the third allegedly charged Trump with retaliating against a witness. According to Wolff, Mueller's team drew up both the three-count indictment of Trump as well as a supporting draft memorandum of law opposing any motion from Congress or the White House. The memo quoted by Wolff says: ""The Impeachment Judgment Clause, which applies equally to all civil officers including the president … takes for granted … that an officer may be subject to indictment and prosecution before impeachment. If it did not, the clause would be creating, for civil officers, precisely the immunity the Framers rejected."" Wolff writes that Mueller agonized for a long time over whether to charge the president before ultimately deciding he could not move to prosecute a sitting president. Wolff's conclusion reads: ""Bob Mueller threw up his hands. Surprisingly, he found himself in agreement with the greater White House: Donald Trump was the president, and, for better or for worse, what you saw was what you got   and what the country voted for.""

New York open government guru fired for sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior,"ALBANY   The founder and longtime leader of the state Committee on Open Government has been fired for acting in a ""sexually inappropriate manner"" toward a female reporter, according a report Tuesday. Robert Freeman, an advocate of strengthening freedom of information laws and government transparency, was previously investigated for similar behavior towards female staffers at the Department of State and had a ""series of sexually suggestive email messages and photographic images"" on his work computer, the Journal News/ lohud.com reported. A complaint was filed against the 72-year-old on June 13 by a ""young female newspaper reporter"" working for the Westchester-based outlet, according to a letter outlining the preliminary findings of investigators obtained by the outlet's Albany Bureau. The 72-year-old ""engaged in conduct that included squeezing her shoulder; touching her waist, back and buttocks with his hand; parting her braids from her face and placing them behind her shoulders; hugging her; and kissing her on the cheek while holding her head,"" according to the letter from the from the state Inspector General's Office. The reporter also told investigators that Freeman made ""very personal and inappropriate statements,"" including ""gender and racially-based derogatory comments."" Freeman ""admitted to many of the allegations"" and the case is being reviewed by the Westchester County District Attorney's Office. The letter, addressed to Secretary of State Rossana Rosado on Monday, also said Freeman also had sexually explicit photographs and emails on his work computer that were exchanged with another woman he may have met last year at Syracuse University. The Journal News report revealed for the first time that Freeman was investigated for inappropriate behavior with several female Department of State employees in 2013. At the time, he was directed to take additional sexual harassment training and was warned he could be fired. The transparency advocate helped found the state Committee on Open Government in 1974 and has been in charge of the bureau since 1976. He often provided reporters with advice on navigating freedom of information laws and other requests for public documents. Freeman's firing comes a week after the state Legislature passed a package of reforms to combat sexual harassment in New York. The bills mandate sweeping changes to state law including the elimination of the ""severe or pervasive"" standard for proving harassment. Many of the changes were sparked by the efforts of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, an advocacy group co-founded by survivors of workplace harassment or sexual abuse while working in the state capital. Freeman did not respond to requests for comment.     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,New York Daily News,left
a strange sighting at gay pride gala: four men accused of hate crime in miami beach,"A South Florida LGBTQ group came under sharp criticism this week after attendees of a gay pride gala in Hard Rock Stadium learned they had been joined at the event by an unlikely   and largely unwanted   bunch of visitors: four men accused of hate crimes in connection with the beating of two gay men after an annual gay pride parade in Miami Beach. The board of directors of SAVE, a Miami-based LGBTQ rights and advocacy nonprofit, apologized Thursday to the gay community and the victims of the April 8, 2018, attack, which was captured on surveillance footage. The four suspects   Juan Carlos Lopez, Luis Alonso Piovet, Adonis Diaz and Pablo Reinaldo Romo-Figueroa   were charged last year under Florida's hate-crime enhancement law . Each of the young men was charged with three counts of aggravated battery committed with prejudice. All the suspects were 20 or 21 years old at the time of the attack. They have pleaded not guilty , but police said Lopez and his companions called the victims maricones, an anti-gay slur in Spanish, before repeatedly punching the two gay men, Rene Chalarca and Dmitry Logunov, in the face. The punches briefly knocked out Logunov. A witness to the attack, Helmut Muller, chased the men and was also beaten up. He sustained a gash to the back of his head that would require four stitches. Miami Beach officials honored him as a ""hero"" for helping the beaten couple. So it came as a surprise to some members of the LGBTQ community in South Florida that the accused men attended the SAVE Champions of Equality Gala on June 14   during Pride month no less. Their appearance there was first reported by South Florida Gay News . The news outlet additionally reported that SAVE Executive Director Tony Lima announced from the stage of the gala that the men had been ""wrongly accused."" In a post to Facebook on Thursday, the group's board of directors said it did not intend to ""support, exonerate or justify the actions of these individuals"" and that it would investigate the circumstances surrounding their appearance and any recognition they may have received from staff. ""We want to extend our deepest apologies first, to the victims, and equally, to the community for any insensitivity that may have been conveyed on our behalf by their attendance and mention at the gala,"" the statement reads. ""We are currently investigating this matter more thoroughly to determine the facts around the attendance and recognition of these individuals and will be providing an update to our supporters and the community at large as soon as we gather all the appropriate information."" Lopez's father, who is gay, said in an interview last year with NBC 6 that he does not believe his son acted out of animus toward the LGBTQ community. The men have volunteered in a limited capacity with SAVE since their arrest and subsequent release, the group said. SAVE said the men were not invited to the gala and bought their own way into the event. Lima, the SAVE executive director, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Miami Herald. A spokesperson for the Miami state attorney's office said the case remains an active criminal prosecution. ""We believe we have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against them: Aggravated Battery with Prejudice/Weapon or Bodily Harm, Aggravated Battery, Assault with Prejudice/or on Religious Institution Grounds, and Assault,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""If that were not the case, the charges would have been dropped in the past.""

"'There are still caring people out there': Taco Bell employees praised for rushing to help elderly, disabled man in drive-thru","Staff at a local fast food joint gained popularity on social media after they rushed out to help an elderly, disabled man whose car ran out of gas in the drive-thru. A community member and mother of three, Tosha Lindquist, witnessed three Taco Bell employees   Issac, Caleb and Jessica   in Sugar Creek, Mo., drop what they were doing and push the man's SUV into a parking spot. She pointed out that they not only pushed the heavy car, but also moved him to a shaded spot, which wasn't the closest or most accessible for them. Lindquist told Yahoo Lifestyle that Caleb pointed out to her that the man was wearing hospital bracelets, including one that read ""fall risk."" According to Lindquist, once the staff members noticed the bracelets, they wanted to help out further. Jessica, who is 6-months pregnant, made sure the man wouldn't be stuck without a car to drive and decided to find a gas can and fill it up for him. She added that she believes that this isn't a one-off act of kindness, and is typical of employees at this branch. ""The employees shared countless other stories of people who had collapsed, and horrible car accidents that they would find themselves witnessing and helping,"" Lindquist told Yahoo Lifestyle. ""I'm so excited that they are receiving recognition for one of the many good deeds they perform on a daily basis.""

judge grants plymouth father equal parenting time after 3 year battle,"After a three-year fight and $150,000 in legal fees, a Plymouth father was awarded a path to equal parenting time with his two children. ""When I read that order it was probably the biggest day of my life,"" said Scott Vogel. In the June 20 ruling, Hennepin County family court referee Jason Hutchinson wrote "". . .these children deserve to have the opportunity to experience the love and care from both their parents."" KARE 11 featured Vogel's story in May, and it sparked an outcry of complaints with the child custody and parenting time system in cases of divorce or separation. Vogel was engaged to the mother of their two children, but before the wedding the couple split apart. Unable to agree on a schedule for the kids, Vogel took their case to court hoping to get more than the four nights-a-month with his son and two nights-a-month with his daughter. In a court-ordered custody and parenting time evaluation, the evaluator found no issues with physical, mental or chemical health from either parent and found both parties ""willing and highly capable of providing care for the children."" Yet, the evaluator recommended giving Vogel his son 34% of the time and his daughter 25% of the time without explaining the reason for the schedule. Currently in Minnesota, both parents have a presumptive baseline of 25 percent parenting time with their children. Most often, parents work out the remaining 50 percent on their own, but if they can't a judge decides it for them. There are 12 factors evaluators must look at in determining what's in the best interest for the child. However, according to one of the only studies of its kind in Minnesota looking at divorce cases from seven counties, the average parenting time for dads was 36 percent. ""Every lawyer or expert I've talked to, or even the judges, start with the assumption that you are not getting 50-50,"" Vogel said in May. Vogel and the mother of their children went to trial where the court referee heard arguments from both sides. For months he's waited for the judge's final decision. Ultimately, the referee weighed three scheduling proposals from Vogel, the mother, and the custody evaluator against the 12 best interest factors for the kids. Hutchinson wrote, ""In short, [Vogel] argues strongly (and credibly) that what is ""developmentally appropriate"" may not be ""one size fits all."" And the Court finds [Vogel] is correct in this argument   the Court is tasked with evaluating what is in the best interests of these children, based on these parents."" Hutchinson said a gradually changing schedule over the next 7 months will lead to full equal parenting time by February. ""The key piece of the order was it came out very clearly that we are both loving and fit parents and the kids need both of us. I have no regrets going through that process and spending that kind of money, but it's sad that I was forced to,"" said Vogel. KARE 11 reached out to the judge who co-signed the case, but she declined to comment on the ruling. Vogel supports a movement to change Minnesota law so that parents are given a rebuttable presumption of equal parenting time from the start for parents who qualify. Opponents of that proposal, including the Minnesota State Bar Association, feel that approach is not the best idea for each case.",legal arguments,Reuters,center

Man suspected of arson arrested after 'massive fireball' tears through home in Hermosa Beach,"Amanda Sains stood at her window in shock as roaring flames chewed through the wooden frame of a three-story home overlooking the sand in Hermosa Beach early Thursday. The orange glow of the inferno lighted up the darkened beach. Thick smoke billowing from the burning home, which was in the process of being rebuilt, filled the salty ocean air. The beachfront homes are packed tightly along the Strand, which meant the fiery inferno was just a few feet from homes where some neighbors were sleeping soundly. Firefighters and police walked from house to house, pounding on doors to wake residents and tell them to evacuate. ""I thought I was watching ' Chernobyl ' again,"" Sains said. ""It felt like the whole neighborhood was on fire."" The home where authorities believed the fire started was destroyed, and four others near 8th Street and Hermosa Avenue were damaged in the blaze. Video from the scene shows flames licking up the frame of one of the houses. The roaring blaze, at its peak, extended several feet past the roof. Hermosa Beach police, who responded with fire crews at about 2 a.m., arrested Christopher Kotva, 27, on suspicion of arson after investigators questioned him about the blaze. Kotva was initially spotted by officers running from the scene. He is being held in lieu of $75,000 bail. It is not clear how the fire started. By the time firefighters arrived at her door to rouse her, Sains, 29, had put in her contact lenses, grabbed her shoes and a few personal items and was starting to head outside. Minutes earlier she had been jolted awake by the repeated screams of a woman: ""Get out! Get out!"" The fire grew to enormous size in just a few minutes. Initial calls to firefighters reported a possible small fire in a building under construction. But in the short time it took for fire crews to respond, the blaze   fueled in part by the piles of lumber on the property   had exploded into an inferno, said Los Angeles County fire Inspector Brian Stevens. Given the close proximity of the homes to one another, firefighters quickly realized they needed more resources and declared it a second-alarm fire. ""It was a massive fireball,"" Stevens said. ""It's amazing the houses next to it didn't burn down."" It took roughly 75 firefighters about an hour to knock down the flames. One firefighter sustained minor injuries and was taken to a hospital for treatment, Stevens said. Neighbors who were concerned that the wind might blow burning embers onto their homes pulled out hoses to spray down their properties. ""It was just a roaring, roaring blaze,"" Sains said.

jewish leaders share concerns over end of vaccine religious exemptions,"Orthodox Jewish leaders and advocates in Rockland generally support the new state law that ends religious exemptions for vaccines, but have concerns that the legislation could infringe on religious liberties and lead to other efforts to do so. ""I share the deep concern that this bill sets a precedent to infringe on religious liberties going forward,"" Shoshana Bernstein, a pro-vaccine activist, said. ""While this measure carries considerable concern for the future, on the other hand, it does provide a desperately needed solution to the current crisis and relief to parents of immunocompromised children."" It's a complex issue, said Bernstein, who has been at the forefront of efforts to educate the Rockland Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish community about vaccine safety. ""There is no perfect way to solve this,"" she said. ""I can't come out totally on one side of this. The hope and prayer is that this will solve the immediate issues without causing extremely worrisome religious liberty issues in the future."" There have been 266 confirmed cases in Rockland since October, and health officials said there are likely many more unreported cases. The outbreak, which has mostly affected those in the Orthodox Jewish community, has led to emergency county orders to stop the spread of the highly contagious virus, as well as anti-vaccine rallies and meetings in Rockland and Brooklyn and a regional drive to educate the public about the necessity and safety of vaccines. MORE REACTION: 'You don't change people's religious beliefs by passing a law' FROM ALBANY: NYS repeals religious exemption for school vaccinations Bernstein, who lives in Monsey and has connections with the immunocompromised community that she advocates for, is one of the authors of an informational vaccine booklet, Tzim Gezint, that was printed for the Kiryas Joel community several years ago and reprinted for Rockland after this outbreak began in October. She is also part of the leadership of the Engaging in Medical Education with Sensitivity Initiative, a nurse-led Orthodox group focused on vaccine education. ""The banning of religious exemptions for vaccines represents a cautious victory,"" EMES said in a statement. ""We share in the concern of possible overreach by the government into religious liberties while at the same time acknowledging this serves as an immediate solution to an ongoing crisis."" Community activist Rivkie Feiner also expressed her support and concern. She was dismayed that a relatively small group of vocal anti-vaccine supporters have led to such drastic measures. ""This is a very small percentage,"" she said of Orthodox Jewish anti-vaxxers, several of whom protested when the state Legislature voted on the bills Thursday. ""They are a fringe of the community ...acting out with extremely destructive behavior. Inappropriate behavior. It's very frustrating that they are the ones that caused this."" Feiner fears that some will stereotype and blame the entire Orthodox Jewish community based on the actions of a few, even though the great majority vaccinate their children, and that the new law could set a precedent for dealing with other issues. ""My main concern is what will happen next and the impact on our religious freedoms,"" she said. REPEAL BASICS: What to know about repeal of religious exemption for vaccinations DECIDING VOTE: A Yonkers Democrat helped save the New York vaccine bill. Here's how. AROUND THE COUNTRY: Most states allow exemptions from school vaccine requirements; status by state Feiner is vocally pro-vaccine, and said culturally sensitive and respectful education is critical and could have helped forego the need for legislation. The Jewish Federation and Foundation of Rockland County thanked the legislators for passing the measure. ""Jewish Federation supports New York State joining four other states in ending the religious exemption for vaccinations; vaccinations which protect the public's health and welfare,"" the statement reads. ""Jewish tradition has long supported the protection of individual and community health. This measure is in keeping with that fundamental tenet and Federation urges all members of the community to be vaccinated.""

Court Upholds Ruling Against Washington Florist Who Refused To Serve Gay Couple,"The Washington Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the state courts had not acted with religious animus when they held that a florist violated the state's anti-discrimination law by refusing to sell flowers to a same-sex couple for their wedding. In this latest decision, the high court upheld its 2017 opinion that found Barronelle Stutzman and her business, Arlene's Flowers, had unlawfully discriminated against Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed by denying them service on religious grounds in 2013. ""We are thrilled that the Court has reaffirmed its ruling in our favor,"" Freed and Ingersoll said in a statement. ""Discrimination hurts, especially while planning what should be one of the happiest times of your life. We hope that this ruling will prevent what happened to us from happening to others."" Previously, the Washington Supreme Court had upheld the Benton County Superior Court in ruling that Stutzman's actions violated the state's Consumer Protection Act and the Washington Law Against Discrimination. Under these laws, a business that chooses to provide a service to couples of the opposite sex must provide that service equally to same-sex couples, prosecutors had argued. Stutzman filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear her case in 2017, but the country's highest court kicked the case back to the Washington Supreme Court in June 2018. The U.S. Supreme Court, which had just ruled in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , directed the state court to reexamine the Arlene's Flowers case in light of that decision. In the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, the justices had set aside Colorado's ruling against the bakery owner on the grounds that state officials had shown animus toward his religious views in reaching their ruling. But the Washington Supreme Court said Thursday that the state courts in its case did not treat Stutzman's religious views with hostility and therefore upheld its decision that her refusal to serve Freed and Ingersoll was not protected by her First Amendment right to free speech. ""After careful review on remand, we are confident that the courts resolved this dispute with tolerance, and we therefore find no reason to change our original judgment in light of Masterpiece Cakeshop,"" the state Supreme Court wrote in a 76-page opinion. ""We again affirm the trial court's rulings."" The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, which represented Freed and Ingersoll, applauded the decision in a statement Thursday. ""We are pleased that the Washington State Supreme Court recognized that the Masterpiece decision does not give people a license to use religion to discriminate,"" said Michele Storms, executive director of the ACLU of Washington. ""Religion is a fundamental right, but businesses open to the public must be open to all."" This article originally appeared on HuffPost .",legal arguments,HuffPost,left

"Ferrari set to drop protest, seek review of Canada penalty","By Alan Baldwin LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari will not formally appeal the penalty that cost Sebastian Vettel victory in the Canadian Grand Prix, sources said on Thursday, but could still seek a review of the decision by presenting fresh evidence. The deadline for the Formula One team to lodge a formal protest is Thursday evening, 96 hours after the end of the race in Montreal. A Ferrari spokeswoman said they were still working on collecting evidence, and could not confirm what action was being taken. A source at the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) told Reuters the team would not be making a formal appeal. The Daily Mail newspaper earlier reported that Ferrari principal Mattia Binotto had written to the FIA to say the team would not protest the five-second penalty applied to Vettel's time after the race. The team had given notice of their intention to appeal on Sunday, with Vettel leading from start to finish but losing out to Mercedes' championship leader Lewis Hamilton after the chequered flag. ""They are stealing the race from us,"" Vettel, a four times world champion, had said over the radio when told he was under investigation for going off track and returning in what was deemed to be a dangerous fashion, forcing Hamilton to take evasive action. The stewards' decision triggered an immediate controversy with some defending the penalty while others felt the officials had killed off an exciting race by over zealous application of the rules. Some ex-drivers, who felt Vettel could have done nothing different, questioned whether the current rules were fit for purpose with Formula One trying to encourage better and more entertaining racing. ""He stayed ahead the entire race, he crossed the chequered flag first, for us he's the moral winner. We won today,"" said Binotto at the time. The sporting regulations do not allow for in-race penalties to be appealed but Ferrari could still seek a review of the stewards' actions under article 14.1.1 of the FIA's International Sporting Code. This allows for further action in the event of any ""significant and relevant new element"" coming to light that was not available to those seeking the review at the time of competition. If Ferrari followed that course, they would have 14 days since the publication of the final race classification to produce fresh evidence. The stewards then have sole discretion to determine whether such a significant and relevant new element existed, with their decision final.

"The World Trusts Science, Global Survey Shows","Trust in science has always been a controversial topic, with people around the world struggling to discern between evidence, facts and beliefs. Yet with more scientific advancements came more achievements and apparently less skepticism. Today, about 7 in 10 people say they trust scientists, although more than half of the world's population admits it understands little about science. A survey published on Wednesday by the international analytics and advisory firm Gallup, together with the Wellcome Trust, a biomedical research charity, reveals that people around the world are interested in knowing more about science and health and 75 percent of those surveyed in 140 countries have confidence in their country's health care system. Additionally, about two-thirds of people worldwide say they are interested in learning more about science, with the strongest levels of interest expressed by those living in low-income countries. The findings come from 140,000 people surveyed and covered topics such as trust in science, scientists and health care information, as well as examining the levels of understanding and interest in science and health, the benefits of science, the compatibility of religion and science and attitudes on vaccines. The survey's findings are published at a time when some polls have shown increased skepticism in science in countries such as the United States . Additionally, the soaring number of measles cases in the U.S. and across Europe have placed new attention on the anti-vaccine movement. Earlier this year the World Health Organization named the anti-vaccine movement as one of the world's top health threats for 2019. Among the survey's major findings: A greater share of younger people claim some knowledge of science than older people. ""Worldwide, more than half the people aged 15 29 (53%) say they know ""some"" or ""a lot"" about science, compared to 40% of those aged 30 49 and 34% of those aged 50 and older, say the authors of the report. Overall, people around the world are interested in science, with 62% saying they would like to learn more about it. The understanding of concepts such as ""science"" and ""scientist"" vary around the world. For example, about 32% of people in Central Africa said ""they understood none of the definitions presented to them or simply didn't know what science and scientist meant,"" the report shows. In contrast, about 2% in Northern America and most of Europe gave a similar answer. 18% of those interviewed have a ""high"" level of trust in scientists; 54% reported ""medium"" levels of trust, 14% have ""low"" trust and 13% said they don't know. About 70% of those surveyed say they feel that science benefits them. Only about 40% say they feel science benefits most people in their nation. The report also examined people's views on the relationship between religion and science. Among people declaring a religious affiliation, more than half said they would favor their religious teachings in any disagreement with science, while only 29% said they would agree with science.

"KLM to help fund Flying-V plane, where passengers fly in the wings","The development of a V-shaped, fuel-efficient airplane design known as the Flying-V is getting a boost with the announcement that Dutch national carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will help to fund it. Intended to improve the sustainability of air travel , the Flying-V was conceived by Justus Benad, then a student at the Technical University of Berlin, and developed by researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, also known as TU Delft. Its futuristic design incorporates the passenger cabin, fuel tanks and cargo hold into the wings. It's claimed the plane will use 20% less fuel than the Airbus A350-900 while carrying a similar number of passengers -- the Flying-V will seat 314, while the Airbus A350 seats between 300 and 350. The design also mirrors the A350's 65-meter (213 feet) wingspan, enabling it to use existing airport infrastructure. ""In recent years, KLM has developed as a pioneer in sustainability within the airline industry,"" Pieter Elbers, CEO and president of KLM, said in a statement. ""We are proud of our progressive cooperative relationship with TU Delft, which ties in well with KLM's strategy and serves as an important milestone for us on the road to scaling-up sustainable aviation."" TU Delft project leader Roelof Vos said such innovation was needed as a stepping stone to greater efficiency while technology was still being developed to create large-scale electric airplanes. ""Aviation is contributing about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and the industry is still growing, so we really need to look at more sustainable airplanes,"" he told CNN. ""We cannot simply electrify the whole fleet, as electrified airplanes become way too heavy and you can't fly people across the Atlantic on electric airplanes -- not now, not in 30 years,"" Vos said. ""So we have to come up with new technologies that reduce fuel burn in a different way. ""We've been flying these tube and wing airplanes for decades now, but it seems like the configuration is reaching a plateau in terms of energy efficiency,"" he said. ""The new configuration that we propose realizes some synergy between the fuselage and the wing. The fuselage actively contributes to the lift of the airplane, and creates less aerodynamic drag."" The plane's increased fuel efficiency is largely a result of its aerodynamic design, Vos explained, although its reduced weight also contributes. The researchers hope to fly a scale model this September, Vos said, while a mock-up of the new cabin design will be open to the public at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport in October, as part of KLM's 100th anniversary celebrations. The completed plane is expected to enter service between 2040 and 2050. The design still requires rigorous testing, Vos told CNN. ""We've done numerical testing and preliminary wind tunnel tests, but we need to do much more testing in wind tunnels -- high speed and low speed -- to demonstrate that this airplane is efficient as we think.""",environmental issues,CNN,left
community celebrates new spaces at st. ann center,"This is what our community is all about, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett told a standing-room-only crowd gathered on Milwaukee's Northside on June 7 to celebrate the expansion of St. Ann Center for Intergenerational Care-Bucyrus Campus, 2450 W. North Ave. ""For all the challenges we face as a city, what we're all about at the end of the day is coming together to try to do what's right for the people who live here."" The ceremony marked the completion of construction on the center's outdoor band shell, dementia care wing, overnight respite center, beauty salon and indoor warm-water pool. St. Ann Center provides child and adult day care and health and educational services to the community at two campuses; it opened its second, the Bucyrus, in 2015 with several spaces left unfinished. A successful capital campaign and a $5 million grant from Wisconsin's capital budget allowed the $28 million two-story, 80,000-square-foot facility to be completed this spring. Speaking at the new Indaba (Swahili for ""gathering place"") Band Shell, Barrett congratulated St. Ann Center for its commitment to serving the Northside and strengthening the community through job creation and civic involvement. Other speakers included U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore ; state Rep. Kaylan Haywood II of the 16th Assembly District; Milwaukee Ald. Russell W. Stamper II ; Sr. Diana De Bruin, director of the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi congregation, and Sr. Edna Lonergan, OSF, founder and president of St. Ann Center. After Haywood, the youngest state legislator in the nation, mentioned he'd celebrated turning 20 two days before, Stamper observed that for almost all of Haywood's life, this site had been a vacant lot. Between 1951 and 1969, many of its homes and businesses were demolished to prepare for construction of the Park West Freeway. After the freeway project was canceled, the remaining buildings were demolished. The vacant land remained a neighborhood concern for decades until purchased by St. Ann Center in 2014 from the city. The celebration featured African drumming and the untying of a kente cloth ribbon by Auxiliary Bishop James Schuerman and Fr. Byron Haaland , plus a Native American eagle dance, a multicultural blessing and libation ceremony, and a song performed by one of the Bucyrus Campus after-school care children. Another highlight: a performance by praise dancers from Parklawn Assembly of God, which partnered with St. Ann Center to raise funds for the band shell. With an audience capacity of 250, the band shell will feature family-friendly entertainment and neighborhood talent. The new dementia care wing has space for 75 adult clients. Four life skills stations each designed to spark memories of past hobbies for people with dementia dot the wing's common area. They include a nostalgic kitchen, nursery, sewing nook and workbench area. The overnight respite center provides nine bed-and-breakfast-style rooms for frail elders and adults with special needs. This service allows caregivers a break from the demands of caregiving time for a vacation, business trip or weekend away. The indoor aquatic center includes a warm-water swimming pool with wheelchair ramp, two lap lanes, a hot tub with a lift and accessible locker rooms. The pool will offer swimming lessons for children, addressing the high rate of drowning among African-American youngsters. The two-chair beauty salon is wheelchair accessible. The salon, aquatic center and respite will be open to the community. All new areas are scheduled to begin operation by the end of summer.

Airlines allowing passengers to cancel flights to Dominican Republic without penalties,"Three airlines are allowing passengers to cancel some flights to the Dominican Republic and change them to other destinations without fees after several American tourists died in the country. A Delta spokesperson told ABC News that the company's policy would temporarily change following the deaths of 10 known tourists at two resort locations on the island nation. ""Delta will work with our customers on an individual basis using situational flexibility to adjust itineraries on flights,"" the spokesperson told ABC News, adding that customers flying in to Punta Cana, a popular tourist destination, would be eligible for the free flight changes. A spokesperson for JetBlue released a lengthy statement noting that customers could receive credit for future JetBlue flights if they choose to cancel rather than rebook their flights to the country. ""The safety of our customers and crewmembers is our first priority. While JetBlue's flights to the Dominican Republic are unaffected, we are working with the U.S. Embassy and local authorities to stay updated on developments,"" the airline said, according to ABC7 . ""To support our customers, we are currently waiving change fees when rebooking flights to/from the Dominican Republic. For customers who wish to cancel their flights, we are waiving the cancellation fee and issuing a credit for future JetBlue travel,"" the statement continued. A spokesperson for American Airlines told ABC that it was ""working with customers on a case-by-case basis."" The FBI announced earlier this month that it had joined the investigation into the deaths of five American tourists in the country, telling reporters at the time that potentially poisoned hotel liquor was being examined by investigators. Ten known U.S. tourists have died at Dominican Republic resorts or in medical facilities immediately following resort stays in the past year. The sicknesses reportedly set in quickly and manifested as abdominal pain, nausea and sweating. Guests who reported illnesses described a ""chemical smell"" in their resort rooms, and authorities are investigating whether the illnesses were related to consuming liquor from the rooms' minibars.",health,ABC News,left
the latest: nadler says panel will move quickly on mcgahn,"WASHINGTON   The Latest on Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller's report (all times local): 5:15 p.m. The House Judiciary Committee chairman says his panel will move ""as quickly as possible"" to seek court enforcement of a subpoena against former White House Counsel Don McGahn. New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler spoke after the House approved a resolution that makes it easier to file lawsuits against witnesses who defy subpoenas. That includes McGahn, who declined last month to provide documents or testimony at the urging of the White House. McGahn is the most-cited witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. The resolution passed 229-191 Tuesday, along party lines. Democrats have moved toward lawsuits as they investigate President Donald Trump and his administration. Mueller found no conspiracy between Trump and Russia, but did not clear him of obstruction. __ 4:30 p.m. The House has approved a resolution that will make it easier to file lawsuits against the Trump administration when officials defy subpoenas. The legislation passed 229-191, along party lines. It empowers Democrats to take legal action to enforce subpoenas against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn. It also allows committee chairmen to take future legal action without a vote of the full House, as long as they have approval from a bipartisan group of House leaders. Tuesday's vote reflects an evolving strategy for Democrats, who have moved toward lawsuits and away from criminal contempt as they investigate President Donald Trump and his administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats ""need answers on the questions left unanswered"" by special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report. ___ 11:20 a.m. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is brushing back impeachment questions, saying ""it's not even close"" to having enough support among House Democrats for a vote. Pelosi said at a policy conference Tuesday that her ""stock goes up"" when President Donald Trump attacks her, as he did last week. Trump lashed out at Pelosi while both were overseas commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. He called her ""Nervous Nancy"" after it was reported she privately told Democrats she'd rather see him voted out of office and ""in prison"" than impeached. Pelosi said she never criticizes the president while abroad and won't do so now because she's ""done with him."" Dozens of House Democrats want Pelosi to start impeachment proceedings from the Trump-Russia report, but she prefers to conduct more investigations. ___ 12:30 a.m. A resolution being voted on in the House would make it easier for Democrats to sue members of President Donald Trump's administration and other potential witnesses who refuse to comply with subpoenas. The House resolution being considered Tuesday would authorize lawsuits against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn for defying subpoenas pertaining to special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It would also empower committee chairmen to take legal action to enforce subpoenas in the future without a vote of the full House, so long as they have approval from a bipartisan group of House leaders. The votes aren't technically necessary, as Democrats already can go to court. But a House vote will give them increased standing if they do decide to file lawsuits.",politics,Louisville Courier Journal,left
"after orlando sentinel reporter is struck at trump rally, state rep. sabatini responds with 'maga'","State Rep. Anthony Sabatini's response to a tweet about a man who attempted to knock the phone out of an Orlando Sentinel reporter's hand at Amway Center was ""MAGA,"" a comment he stood by Wednesday despite the man being arrested and charged with battery. Sabatini, R-Howey-in-the-Hills, first replied to an Orlando Sentinel tweet quoting reporter Michael Williams that ""a Trump supporter tried knocking my phone out of my hand as I was recording him being kicked out of the Amway Center."" Sabatini later responded to another tweet, which pointed out that the man was arrested, by writing that ""the most appropriate reaction"" to Sentinel coverage ""is to not comment on its spin and sensation, but to ignore the content and reply with the peaceful phrase they hate   MAGA."" MAGA is the Trump campaign's now-former slogan of ""Make America Great Again.'' The president announced his new slogan , """"Keep America Great!"", or ""KAG!"" at his kickoff rally. In a phone interview Wednesday, Sabatini said the initial tweet ""was another example of selective editorial bias. You're searching for incidents that were very rare at the event in order to cast a dark, negative light on the event."" Told that it was a reporter describing what had just happened to him personally, Sabatini repeated that ""my reaction to it is writing 'MAGA' and see how people interpret it. It's interesting journalists see a neutral phrase and interpret it as something it's not."" Sabatini was criticized by Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who wrote on Twitter, ""It's one thing to support Trump, but it's another to joke about violence. Not ok. … To be honest, I don't care who encourages the violence - it just shouldn't be encouraged by anyone."" The man who was arrested, Daniel Patrick Kestner, 51, of St. Augustine, was charged with battery ""for willingly striking Williams without permission,"" according to a police report, ""based on video evidence and Kestner's sworn statement."" Williams, who identified himself as a reporter, ""was videotaping two men, one of which was Kestner, involved in an argument in reference to the Trump Rally,"" the police report states. ""Kestner told Williams to stop recording and stated that he would kick Williams in the testicles. Kestner approached Williams and used his right hand to slap Williams' right hand, which was holding the phone."" Williams held onto the device, and video footage from both it and a police officer's body camera captured the incident. Kestner was also intoxicated, according to the police report. He was taken to the Orange County Jail. As he left the facility Wednesday morning, Kestner told Knight News Wednesday he wanted to extend an apology to Williams. ""Yeah, absolutely,"" Kestner told Knight News . He was ""100 percent"" remorseful and claimed to have had ""no idea"" that Williams was a reporter. A second arrest Tuesday was of Steven Ashley Ingram, 33, of Haines City, who was charged with disorderly conduct just outside the Amway Center, where the rally was held.

Man Dies After Eating 'White Substance' While Fleeing Waukegan Police; Family Says Officers Used Excessive Force,"CHICAGO (CBS)   The family of a man who died after eating a ""white substance"" while fleeing police in north suburban Waukegan is using officers of using excessive force. Waukegan police said detectives went to a home on the 600 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue around 3 p.m. Thursday to execute a search warrant for drugs. When they arrived, they saw 31-year-old Avion Cotton pull up in his truck and approach the house. Police said he was the subject of an active arrest warrant, and began running away when detectives approached him, but he fell down. Officers caught up to him and arrested him. Avion Cotton, 31, died after police said he ingested an ""unknown white substance"" while being arrested in Waukegan on June 27, 2019. Cotton's family said police used excessive force. (Source: Family Photo) While he was being placed into custody, Cotton allegedly began chewing on an ""unknown white substance,"" police said. He refused police commands to spit it out, and became ""physically distressed."" Paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Cotton's family and other witnesses said police used excessive force. ""They was beating up Avion. They was tasing him,"" his cousin Anita Johnson said. ""He wasn't violent. He wasn't a gangbanger. Yes, he had been to prison. Yes, he did wrong, but that's not who he was a person. There's just things he's done."" Witnesses said officers used force on Cotton even though he wasn't moving. ""He wasn't fighting them. They was on him, and choking him, macing him,"" witness Nicki Flowers said. ""When I came out of the house he was laying in the yard with handcuffs on. He couldn't do nothing, because he had handcuffs on. I had seen eight officers jump out over him. When they was standing over him he wasn't moving.""

booker shares 'profoundly alarming' stories of women seeking asylum,"Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.

Please don't look away."" Today I crossed the US-Mexico border in El Paso with @fams2gether and @LasAmericasIAC to help five women present themselves for asylum. These are my observations. Please don't look away. - Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) July 3, 2019 Booker wrote that one woman said she spent one month in detention while she was seeking asylum. He added that the woman said people in the detention center had to stand in the sun all day without food and sometimes without water. Booker continued, writing that one woman - whose name he did not share ""out of concern for her safety"" - left her home under threat of rape. ""Like thousands of others, under the Trump Administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, she is stuck in limbo in Mexico,"" he wrote.

The presidential candidate added that one woman told him she had bruises across her back ""from sleeping on the hard floor of the detention center."" ""She wasn't able to shower for over 20 days and has rashes on her skin from the lack of sanitation,"" Booker tweeted. Booker said he helped the women present themselves for asylum with Families Belong Together and Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which provides legal services to migrants. The senator said Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center would ""monitor"" the women throughout the process of applying for asylum to ensure they can remain in the U.S. The senator called seeking asylum a ""legal right"" and said it ""shouldn't take a member of Congress to help people cross into our country.""

'Major disappointment.' Downtown Miami fireworks show cut short after bomb scare,"Downtown Miami cut short its Fourth of July fireworks show Thursday night after a bomb scare prompted police to clear out a nearby road, briefly sending pedestrians fleeing before the situation calmed down. ""It's a major disappointment for a lot of people,"" said Commissioner Joe Carollo, chairman of the Bayfront Park trust that puts on the annual show, one of the largest in Miami-Dade County. He said a fireworks show scheduled to last 15 minutes ended after about seven minutes when city police instructed the launches to stop. Jose Solano, the park's executive director, said city police told him to halt the show after officers discovered a suspicious package nearby. ""It's disappointing,"" Solano said. ""I understand. They've got to do their jobs."" The scare and surprisingly short fireworks display   which ended about 9:10 p.m.   both played out on social media, with some users posting alarming videos of people fleeing Bayfront Park and others annoyed at the quick ending. A Miami police spokesperson said she could not confirm information about the agency intervening with the fireworks show. Kenia Fallat said officers did clear out a service road behind the adjoining Bayside Marketplace where the package was found but did not order a widespread evacuation of the crowded park. Miami police dispatched its bomb squad to the area after an abandoned suitcase was reported as suspicious. After 10 p.m., the squad exploded the suitcase and found no bomb. In a tweet, Miami police said the package was ""deemed safe."" The false alarm left an entire barge of fireworks unignited in Biscayne Bay. That was going to be the grand finale of one of the best fireworks shows the city would have ever seen, according to its designer. ""Everything was gorgeous, beautiful,"" said Gary Avins, owner of Firepower Displays Unlimited, a South Miami-Dade company that has been doing the Bayfront show for about 20 years. ""I had put in some new effects I had designed this past year."" Avins said one of his crew members took Solano's call, but he brushed off his employee. ""I'm in the middle of shooting a show,"" Avins recalled. ""I said, 'Tell him I'll call him back."" Though he's been launching fireworks on the Miami waterfront for two decades, Avins has been in fireworks business for 40 years. Until Thursday night, he said he had never gotten a call from authorities to shut down a show. It was only when the number of a Miami fire marshal assigned to the show appeared on Avins' cellphone that the fireworks impresario realized something was wrong. He told his crew to stop igniting the rockets, ending the display about halfway through. ""This was one of the best shows ever,"" he said wistfully.     ©2019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",crime,Miami Herald,left
Aretha Franklin's youngest son has filed for control over the late singer's estate,"A Michigan judge has been asked to decide whether one of Aretha Franklin's sons could take control of the late singer's estate and replace its current representative. Kecalf Franklin, the singer's youngest son, filed two court petitions Monday seeking to be named a personal representative of his mother's estate. He intends to be a co-representative of the estate along with Sabrina Owens -- who was appointed to that role last year -- and eventually replace her, according to court documents. Owens is Franklin's niece. The singer's son claims Owens has ""mismanaged the estate"" and has ""failed to perform a duty pertaining to office."" He says Owens didn't share an inventory of his mother's estate until about four months after the singer's death in August, according to the documents. A personal estate representative is expected to prepare an inventory of the decedent's proprty within 91 days after being appointed, according to Michigan state law. The singer's son also alleges Owens has not discussed details about the investigation into the appraised value of Franklin's music catalog or negotiations for television series and a biopic based on his mother's life, the document states. Attorneys for the estate said Monday ""there is no basis to support the assumption"" that Kecalf Franklin has the ability, skill or knowledge to act as the estate's representative, according to a court filing. They also noted he is in ""direct conflict"" with other family members and Kecalf's requests are intended to ""micro-manage the estate,"" the document states. CNN has reached out to a spokeswoman for Franklin's estate. The dispute comes as a judge is set to review the admissibility of one of three handwritten wills by the late singer. After the wills were discovered in May by Owens, attorneys for Franklin's four sons were unable to resolve the issue and headed to court to determine if the wills are admissible to probate. A handwriting expert has been hired to review the wills but the examination has not been completed.",legal arguments,CNN,left

Flying Wallendas make history in crossing Times Square 25 stories in the air,"The Flying Wallendas astonished the world once again , becoming the first to cross New York's Times Square on a tightrope 25 stories above the city streets. A huge crowd at the iconic New York square was pulling for famed daredevil Nik Wallenda and his sister Lijana as they made the nerve-racking 1,300 foot crossing between 1 Times Square and 2 Times Square. Nik started first from 2 Times Square at 9:20 p.m. Lijana started about a minute later at 1 Times Square. The two slowly made their way toward the other, chatting with each other, Lijana singing at times, and talking to their father via a communications system as the world listened in a live ABC broadcast . ""This has been my life, longer than I've been alive,"" Nik said at one point during the wire walk. The breathtaking feat was Lijana's first time performing since she was seriously injured in a 2017 fall , when she and four others fell 30 feet from a tightrope during a rehearsal. About 17 dramatic minutes in, the two met. Lijana then sat down on the wire, and Nik crossed over her. After a few tense moments when Lijana realized she had rehooked her pole wrong, they went on to finish at the opposite end from where they started. For Nik, it was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream of ""paying homage"" to his family's performance at Madison Square Garden in 1928, he told ABC. Nik said before the act that he was worried about his sister, who had worked so hard to come back from her injuries two and a half years earlier. Lijana was worried about her brother because he was worried about her. Before the performance, Lijana said she was really nervous because it's so high up. ""I've got this,"" she said. ""I've got this."" Nik and Lijana are the seventh generation of the Great Wallendas. Their great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, brought the family to America from Germany to perform for The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, according to ABC.

Teenage girl still missing after man wanted in Carson killing is arrested in Mexico,"A man suspected in a Carson homicide was arrested last week in Mexico after a months-long search, but the woman and teenage girl he was believed to be traveling with are still missing, authorities said. Roman Cerratos, 39, was extradited to Los Angeles on Friday, but charges against him have not yet been filed with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, officials said. Maricela Mercado, 40, who is also a suspect in the Carson homicide investigation, and her daughter, 15-year-old Alora Benitez, have not been located, according to Los Angeles County sheriff's officials. Investigators linked Cerratos and Mercado to the killing of 32-year-old Jeffery Appel, whose body was found April 16 in the front seat of a white Audi parked in the 400 block of East Carson Plaza Drive. Two days later, sheriff's officials posted a bulletin asking for the public's help in finding the pair, who were said to be armed and dangerous. Authorities said the two were seen traveling with a teenage girl the morning of April 17 in Torrance in a white 2013 BMW sedan with a plate that read MARIMAR. That day, Cerratos was stopped by a deputy in nearby Lomita and cited for a DUI warrant, said Sgt. Andrew Gill of the Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Lomita. He was immediately released after the citation. Gill said he did not know what vehicle Cerratos was driving when he was pulled over or whether anyone was in the car with him. ""Obviously we wouldn't have known he was implicated in a homicide, or we wouldn't have let him go,"" he said. Authorities found the missing BMW sedan abandoned two days later in the San Ysidro area, a major border crossing to Mexico. Two months after the car was found, Cerratos was escorted by FBI agents from Guadalajara to Los Angeles, according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller. Ricardo Santiago, a spokesman with the L.A. County district attorney's office, said Cerratos was scheduled to appear in a Bellflower courthouse Monday for a probation violation case related to driving under the influence. He pleaded guilty in 2012 to two misdemeanor counts related to the DUI case. Anyone with information about the case or the whereabouts of Mercado or Alora can call the Sheriff's Department's Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500.

ramapo college nj anglers make waves at national bass tournament,"Like most bass anglers, Alex Johnson and Ryan Worth were good for a few good fishing tales. Since the two Ramapo College students qualified for the YETI FLW College Fishing National Championship earlier this month, their stories have just gotten longer. Worth and Johnson, representing the only New Jersey college to have an active fishing club, were among 155 two-person teams competing over three days in the tidal Potomac in Maryland for best total live weight catch of bass. It was only bass: largemouth, smallmouth and spotted. ""Bass fishing is more challenging,"" Johnson said. ""You're constantly moving around. I fish bass because it's a sport. You're not sitting down, cracking a few beers and waiting for something to happen."" The tournament entrants fished for their five heaviest bass caught each day on lures, no live bait, and brought them in for weighing before release. The pair placed 17th the first day with five bass at a total weight of 14 pounds, 10 ounces. They ran into 6-foot swells the second day, never reached their preferred fishing spot and failed to qualify for the third-day championship round. They finished in 78th place. This was the second national tournament for Johnson, who said he didn't do much fishing growing up in Milltown. ""My dad would go fishing now and then, but I didn't have a crazy fishing family,"" Johnson said. ""I didn't fish until my junior year in high school, when a friend told me they were starting a fishing club."" He said he had no clue what to do and didn't realize how seriously the sport was taken. After the first catch, he said: ""This is awesome."" Johnson wasn't sure about attending college after high school graduation, but when he heard Ramapo College had a fishing club, he was in. The rising college senior said he's majoring in film and has managed to combine it with his love of fishing. ""If I can't make it as a fishing professional, I'll film people fishing professionally,"" he said. The Maryland tournament was the first for Worth, who, in contrast, has been ""holding a pole since I was 2 years old."" ""We'd fish Shinnecock Bay on Long Island,"" said the Ronkonkoma native. ""My dad had a boat. We were part of a club to see who could catch the biggest fish."" Explosion: One person injured in explosion that obliterated Ridgefield home MLB: Five takeaways from the New York Yankees' series in the Windy City Movie: First look: Clifton's Rachel Zegler as Maria on 'West Side Story' set Worth estimates he's fished four or five tournaments a year as a student at Ramapo, where he graduated with a degree in environmental studies. ""I had never fished a bass tournament my whole life,"" Worth said. ""We caught tuna, marlin, shark. But bass fishing is different, more challenging."" Coach Phillip Bartolotto, assistant athletic director at Ramapo, started the club in 2009 with no boat and two members. The club is now up to 10 members and relies on sponsorships, which help with equipment and discounts. The Ramapo River runs through campus, but Bartolotto said the team isn't allowed to fish its campus pond. ""There's an animal ethics group on campus, and they don't want us fishing there, so we all have to get along on campus,"" Bartolotto said. Johnson said the club's particular challenge is acquiring boats, as members who owned them are graduating. ""For a college kid to purchase a boat is not a reasonable thing,"" Johnson said.

Germany's Merkel says she's OK after shaking at ceremony,"BERLIN (AP)   German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared unsteady and was visibly shaking Tuesday as she greeted the new Ukrainian leader in the hot sun in Berlin, saying later that she clearly hadn't drunk enough water. Merkel's whole body visibly shook and she pursed her lips as she tried to contain the situation as she stood with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the 28-degree Celsius (82-degree Fahrenheit) heat while a military band played their national anthems outside the chancellery. But following the anthems, Merkel seemed better, walking quickly along the red carpet with Zelenskiy into the building, pausing to greet the military band and take a salute. About an hour later, following their meeting, Merkel told reporters at a joint news conference that they had discussed bilateral issues and the Minsk peace process during Zelenskiy's first visit to the German capital as president. Merkel, who turns 65 next month, smiled broadly after a reporter asked whether her shaking was cause for concern, saying that she was fine. ""Since then I've drunk at least three glasses of water, which I apparently needed, and now I'm doing very well,"" she said. She laughed and gave Zelenskiy a smile when he assured reporters the chancellor had been secure at his side. ""She was totally safe,"" he said. The dpa news agency reported that this was not the first time Merkel has been seen shaking under similar circumstances in the hot sun. It did not give a date for that incident, but said it was also ascribed to Merkel not drinking enough water. And in 2014, Merkel postponed a television interview at the last minute after reported weakness, but her spokesman said at the time she was able to carry it out later after eating and drinking something. It is not publicly known if Merkel, who has led Germany since 2005, has any health problems. German privacy laws are very strict on that type of information.",health,AP,center
"To Honor The Troops, Pals Paint Huge American Flag On Lawn In Bourbonnais; 'That's The American Spirit'","CHICAGO (CBS)   At one house in Bourbonnais, cutting the grass is just the beginning of a massive Independence Day project.

Neighbor Mike Cherry said O'May and Shear put a lot of work getting the lawn ready. ""They've cleaned it up. I mean, they took out bushes, trees, junk, everything out of there,"" he said. ""It just brings a feeling,"" O'May said. Even though he hasn't served in the military, O'May said he has friends and family who have, so he wanted to show his appreciation in the best way he could. The stars and stripes now take up his whole front yard. ""That's the American spirit,"" Cherry said. A carpenter, O'May said he made sure to have all the measurements exact before they started painting. ""Usually the saying is measure twice, cut once, but here we're measuring twice and spraying once,"" he said. ""I wanted to make sure that it was drawn to scale. I did as much as I could from my side all the way to the property line. I got all 50 stars in there, 13 stripes."" It might be a huge flag, but O'May said it's just a small show of appreciation for history and the men and women of the military. The final product measures approximately 40 feet by 26 feet. ""These guys over here, I don't think they could go any further with it without offending the local authorities,"" neighbor Anthony Fortino joked. O'May said it's the second year he's painted the American flag on his front yard. ""After we did it the first time, as soon as it got done, and we looked at it, we realized that this is going to have to get done every year,"" he said. ""There's no escaping it. It's not just for us. It's for men and women shipped overseas, to their community around us."" ""The easy answer is freedom for everybody here, men and women overseas,"" Shear said.

""If you talk to Democrats, who are working for different campaigns, all of the aggressive gossip whisperers - and this is where the action is happening in terms of opposition research - it's people having a few drinks at a bar and whispering, 'You know there is something wrong with the former vice president,'"" she said. Last week, Kennedy said Biden's staff should keep their candidate ""off a main stage"" because he says ""stupid things and he slurs,"" adding that Biden ""does look very tired."" Hannity, who nicknamed Biden ""Sleepy Joe,"" also called the former vice president ""tired,"" adding ""he does not have the energy for this."" In a statement to The Daily Beast, Biden campaign press secretary TJ Ducklo said, ""These are baseless lies meant to stoke fear in their viewers. It has no place in our public discourse, and anyone amplifying it bears some responsibility for giving it legitimacy it most certainly does not deserve.""

terron clayborn sentenced for killing dpw worker in hit-and-run crash,"The driver who hit and killed a Milwaukee public works employee who was filling potholes earlier this year was sentenced to 12 years in prison Thursday. Bryan Rodriguez was unloading asphalt from a Department of Public Works truck to fill potholes when he was pinned between the truck and a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina driven by Terron Clayborn. At his sentencing Thursday in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Clayborn also was given 11 years of extended supervision once he is released from prison. ""There has to be a strong punishment because a person's life was taken,"" Judge Jeffrey Wagner said before handing down the sentence. He questioned how Clayborn could ""completely flaunt"" the law by driving without a license, adding, ""Had you been following the law this wouldn't have happened in the first place."" Clayborn has never had a valid driver's license and has 14 prior convictions for driving after suspension dating back five years, according to the complaint. ""I'm very sorry to the family. I take full responsibility. I didn't mean for this to happen,"" Clayborn said in court. ""I freaked out. I got scared. I am sorry,"" he said about why he ran from the scene. ""[Rodriguez] was doing nothing other than trying to make the city a better place,"" Assistant District Attorney Grant Huebner said, a sentiment the judge echoed. Multiple letters were read to the court on behalf of Rodriguez with loved ones requesting Clayborn be sentenced to the maximum 18 years in prison. When the sentence was handed down, some of Clayborn's family members complained and left the courtroom, while others were in tears. None would talk about the sentence. The fatal crash took place at North 17th and West Vine streets about 8:15 a.m. Feb. 8. Clayborn ran from the scene with his girlfriend, who had to climb out the back window of the Chevy because of the severe damage to the front end, according to a criminal complaint. After the crash, Clayborn and his girlfriend waved down a driver who took them to the girlfriend's house. She wanted to go to a hospital but Clayborn threatened her with a gun and demanded that she drive him to his brother's house, according to the complaint. ""I was just helping a friend get some kids to school,"" Clayborn said about his decision to drive that day. To which the judge responded, ""That's not an excuse to break the law."" At the hospital, the complaint said, the girlfriend told staff Clayborn killed someone and that she was scared he was going to kill her.

Great White Shark Tracked Heading Up Jersey Shore Coast Toward Ocean City,"OCEAN CITY, N.J. (CBS)   A great white shark is creating quite a buzz down the shore. Scientists are tracking an 800-pound shark named Miss May that's been spotted off the coast of Cape May County. After Miss May was pinged about 10 miles off the coast of Cape May Tuesday, she has appeared to go a bit more out to sea on Wednesday, providing a little comfort to those who are not too fond of sharks. The shallow waters off 9th Street in provided some much-needed relief from the heat for some Ocean City visitors Wednesday. But not far beyond the horizon is one of nature's most perfect predators: a great white shark.

Great White Shark Detected Off Cape May Coast Tuesday Morning Her tracker pinged less than 10 miles off Cape May Tuesday night and a ping Wednesday morning shows she's heading north toward Ocean City. ""I asked her to please check her phone earlier to see where it was. I said I'm not going in the water because I want to know where it is,"" Ocean City visitor Alycia Kohn-Reed said.

Former assistant principal charged with murder of Florida educator,"MIAMI - A former assistant principal at Norland High School in Miami Gardens, Fla., has been arrested and charged with murdering educator Kameela Russell, whose body was discovered floating in a Miami Gardens canal. Police detectives took Ernest Joseph Roberts, 39, into custody early Friday morning. Police obtained an arrest warrant for a charge of first-degree murder. Sources say investigators believe they found forensic evidence that Russell died inside the house, and that he disposed of her car, which was later found by police detectives. Phone records also placed Russell at Roberts' Miami Gardens home when she disappeared, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Russell, a popular test proctor at the Northwest Miami-Dade high school, was last seen alive May 15 pulling into her aunt's driveway. She abruptly drove off and vanished. She went missing for more than a week before a teenager found her washed up on the banks of a canal squeezed between Florida's Turnpike and a gated neighborhood called Andover. The canal is across the street from Roberts' house. The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office ruled that Russell died of blunt-force trauma. Investigators immediately honed in on Roberts, the ex-assistant principal at Norland, who Russell's family says has known the woman since childhood. Her mother, Linda Russell, initially told the Miami Herald that she did not believe Roberts had anything to do with her disappearance. ""That would surprise me because I've never seen anything that would warrant all of that,"" Linda Russell said last week. Roberts, hired by Miami-Dade County Public Schools in 2004, had been an assistant principal at Norland alongside Russell. But in February, he was transferred to Linda Lentin K-8 Center in North Miami. Why he was transferred is unknown. Days after Russell went missing - and before her body was found - Miami Gardens police detectives secured a search warrant to search his home on the 1500 block of Northwest 203rd Street.

Australian student in North Korea reported missing,"An Australian student studying in North Korea has been reported missing, after his family said they had not heard from him in two days. In a statement seen by CNN, a spokesperson for the family of Alek Sigley, 29, said he had ""not been in digital contact"" with friends and family since Tuesday morning Australian time, which was ""unusual for him."" While North Korea's communication infrastructure has modernized in recent years, it still lags much of the world in reliability. The family spokesperson, who asked not to be named, added that it was not confirmed whether Sigley has been detained. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Wednesday it was providing consular services ""to the family of an Australian man who has been reported as being detained in North Korea,"" but did not name Sigley citing privacy concerns. Sigley is studying Korean literature at Kim Il Sung University, North Korea's most prestigious institution of higher learning. He also founded a tour group called Tongil Tours, according to his Twitter page. He has written several pieces about his experience for the North Korean specialty website NK News and, earlier this year, for The Guardian , in an essay titled ""I'm the only Australian living in North Korea. Let me tell you about it."" His Twitter account is popular among North Korea watchers, as Sigley is one of few people who regularly tweets from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. North Korea's domestic internet is not connected to the outside world. Sigley's last tweet was sent Monday, in Korean and English, showing new signage above the Ryugyong Hotel -- the infamous uncompleted North Korean skyscraper which some have dubbed one of the world's ugliest buildings . Sigley first visited North Korea in 2012, his family said in the statement. He is fluent in Korean and Mandarin.",crime,CNN,left
Free summer meal program serving thousands of kids kicks off in Sacramento City Unified,"More than 35 Sacramento area schools and community centers are opening their cafeterias this summer to provide free breakfast and lunch for children in the region. Sacramento City Unified School District on Monday kicked off this year's program, in which students and Sacramento residents under age 18 can enjoy pancakes and sausage in the morning, and homestyle chicken strips for lunch. The district has been serving the summer meals for more than 20 years Sacramento City Unified serves an average of 3,000 breakfasts and 5,000 lunches each day through the Summer Food Service Program, a federally funded program that does not have an impact on the district's budget. The school district says it is reimbursed for the food and labor expenses. The district serves more than 45,000 meals daily throughout the school year, and about two-thirds of those students qualify for free or reduced priced lunch   which helps explain the need for the program, officials said. Jacquez Cosby, a 17-year-old student taking summer school at Rosemont High School, said it's his first time eating a meal in the program and at school. ""I just wouldn't eat until I got home. I'd like, not eat at school, I'd eat in the morning and I'd eat when I got home. that was it. There was no in between,"" Cosby said. ""It did make it definitely harder to study because like when you're thinking about food you're not thinking about like what you're supposed to be doing at school. It's really much of a distraction."" The school sites do not require paperwork, registration or identification to receive a meal. Children do not need to be enrolled in a program to receive a free meal. ""We know that there are low income students that need these meals throughout the summer, and we want to make sure we are doing what we can to provide them with these meals,"" said district spokeswoman Catalina Martinez. Many school districts in the area have summer meal programs, including Natomas, Twin Rivers and Elk Grove Unified. Sacramento City Unified has the largest number of sites among area districts. To find a school site that provides free summer meals in the district, text the word FOOD or COMIDA to 877877 or call 211 for dates and mealtime information and locations.

us had open beds as migrant kids languished at texas station,"HOUSTON (AP)   As more than 200 children languished in troubling conditions in a remote Border Patrol station, the government's system of child detention facilities had at least 500 beds available, according to records provided to The Associated Press. The records show that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had beds available in facilities in several states, including Texas, Arizona, and California. In total, the network on June 17 had 512 open beds in shelters. A few days later, it had 402 shelter beds. Meanwhile, some 250 infants, children, and teenagers were detained in Clint, Texas, for up to 27 days. Lawyers who visited the facility told The Associated Press they had inadequate food, water and sanitation and at least 15 children had the flu. Some were fed uncooked frozen food or rice and had gone weeks without bathing. Advocates and experts on the detention of immigrant children said at least some of the unused beds could have gone to children in Border Patrol custody and blamed poor communication between the government agencies for the lapse. ""Five hundred is a big enough number that they should be able to alleviate some of the pressure at the border,"" said Jennifer Podkul, senior director of policy and advocacy at the group Kids in Need of Defense. Under federal law, the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for sheltering migrant children until they are placed with family sponsors. While complaints have arisen about the treatment of children in the department's custody, its facilities are considered far superior to Border Patrol stations. The Border Patrol is supposed to hold children in most instances for no longer than 72 hours, after which it's supposed to send the children to Health and Human Services. HHS' system remains close to full, at around 94% capacity in the most recent records provided to AP. In a statement, the agency said it was ""virtually impossible"" for the department to reach 100% capacity because certain beds are set aside for certain age groups or classes of children. The department is also trying to expand bed space, announcing Wednesday that it was close to opening a facility for up to 1,300 kids in Carrizo Springs, Texas. Workers are preparing the site, which once housed oilfield workers, by removing mold spots and repairing the air conditioning. The conditions in Clint, first reported last week by The Associated Press, caused mass outrage. By Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said a majority of the children in the facility when lawyers visited had been transferred to HHS. But more than 100 were taken back to the Clint station, CBP said. Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, questioned whether government agencies were sharing information as well as they could. The gaps between government agencies arose last year when President Donald Trump's administration enacted a zero-tolerance policy that led to thousands of family separations, when agencies lost track of parents and children after separating them and in some cases deporting parents. ""This administration has not chosen to devote time, energy, or resources, to make sure the agencies communicate and share information with each other when it's in the best interest of the children,"" Altman said. ""We have long known that the choice to hold children in deplorable conditions and to delay transfer out of (Border Patrol) processing was never really about the money."" Advocates say children are detained much longer than before in Health and Human Services custody   leading to high capacity numbers and backlogs   due to Trump administration policy. The agency last year entered an agreement with immigration authorities to share information about sponsors, which advocates warned would discourage adult relatives living in the U.S. illegally from coming forward. The agency said it has narrowed some of its requirements this year to expedite the release of children. Last week, it suspended fingerprinting and biometric checks for grandparents, adult siblings, and other close relatives who came forward as sponsors. It also moved to release children to sponsors before the completion of state welfare checks in cases where there are no specific child welfare concerns.",legal arguments,Business Insider,center
Venezuelan ex-electric chief among 2 indicted in US,"MIAMI (AP)   Two former Venezuelan officials have been indicted on U.S. money-laundering charges, including the ex-minister for electricity, who was fired after a series of blackouts, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Luis Alfredo Motta Dominguez, 60, faces seven counts of money laundering and one count of money-laundering conspiracy, Miami U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a news release. Motta and Eustiquio Jose Lugo Gomez, 55, awarded $60 million in contracts to three Florida-based companies in return for bribes, most of which were laundered through South Florida financial institutions, prosecutors said. Lugo was procurement director at Venezuela's state-run Corpoelec, which Motta also headed. Also Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that sanctions have been imposed on Motta and Lugo that blocks all property and interests in property and any entities they own or control. The action would prohibit any dealings by U.S. persons that involve any of the two men's property or property interests. ""The illegitimate (President Nicolas) Maduro regime exploits the public trust by plundering Venezuelan assets, enriching themselves, and watching idly as basic public systems needlessly and catastrophically fail,"" Mnuchin said in a statement. ""Treasury will continue to target officials who exacerbate corruption at the expense of the Venezuelan people and knowingly fail to provide basic public service."" Authorities say the two are not in U.S. custody. It wasn't clear Thursday if they had U.S. lawyers to represent them. The three Florida companies are Oriental Trading Corp., Search Trading and Headline, according to court documents. The contracts were for forklifts, transformers, generators and lightbulbs. Motta, an army general, was axed as electricity minister in April by Maduro after a series of nationwide blackouts that left some parts of the country in the dark for weeks. The government blamed the outages on the U.S., saying it sabotaged the nation's largest dam. But experts said it was more likely caused by years of neglect compounded by seasonal wind fires that blazed across a transmission line. Two other men involved in the plot with Motta and Lugo pleaded guilty on Monday to corruption charges, prosecutors said Thursday. Jesus Ramon Veroes, 69, of Venezuela, and 54-year-old Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad of Miami admitted conspiring to pay the bribes in exchange for the Corpoelec contracts. In addition to maximum five-year prison sentences, they will be required to forfeit at least $5.5 million in profits from the scheme and real estate in the Miami area, prosecutors said.",legal arguments,AP,center
"webuildthewall inc., group behind private border wall, investigated","The private group led by a University of Arizona graduate that has raised more than $23 million online from individual donors to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is now under investigation, just as construction a half-mile stretch of wall in private land in New Mexico is slate to resume. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said it opened an investigation into WeBuildTheWall Inc. on May 17 after receiving three consumer complaints from the Office of the Florida Attorney General. The group, which is registered in Florida as a tax-exempt non-profit organization, was founded by Brian Kolfage, a 37-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran who lived in Tucson for about 10 years and graduated from the University of Arizona. Follow Arizona politics? Our reporters stay on top of it all. Subscribe to azcentral.com . ""As this matter is now an active investigation, the Department cannot comment further. No additional information is available at this time,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture said in a written statement. But the complaints focus on the group's tax exempt status and plans to raise additional funds for border wall construction. Kolfage moved to Florida with his family after living in southern Arizona for a decade. In December, he launched a GoFundMe account to raise money online to build a border wall , raising about $20 million. His initial plan was to transfer the funds to the federal government. But after they told him the money would go into a general fund, he founded WeBuildTheWall, Inc., to transfer the GoFundMe amount and raise additional money. The group announced over Memorial Day weekend that it had begun construction to fill a half-mile gap with bollard fencing on private land in Sunland Park, N.M, west of El Paso, at a cost of about $6 million. Construction on the barrier halted on Tuesday after the city said the group did not have the necessary permits to build it. But on Thursday, Kolfage said that Sunland Park had re-issued the permits and they were able to restart construction. On Thursday, Kolfage held a press conference, along with former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, to mark the resumption of construction of the half-mile stretch of fencing. They did not talk about the investigation launched in Florida. But Kolfage said that after construction wrapped up in New Mexico, the group would begin work elsewhere along the border. However, he said he would not disclose the location of future projects to avoid threats and intimidation toward the group and local landowners. ""We've been networking on the border, going through state to state, property owner to property owner, figuring out who we could have an impact with and who had issues,"" Kolfage said. ""In the current pipeline right now, we have 10 properties where we can use that. Ten that are ready to go."" In February, Kolfage held a town hall in Green Valley, south of Tucson. He was joined by Kobach and former Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon to talk about WeBuidTheWall and their plans to build additional fencing using private funds.

"shop that planned to sell cbd, vape products won't open in delafield","CITY OF DELAFIELD - A specialty store that would sell CBD products was shot down at the June 17 common council meeting. The council voted down a motion to approve Soothing Senses by a 4-2 vote. According to applicant Stephanie Lembke, the shop would have offered health and beauty products including essential oils, CBD, bath salts, air purifier bags and a limited supply of vapes and juices. Council members Jackie Valde and Jim Behrend voted in favor of the business coming, while Tim Aicher, Doug Saloga, Wayne Dehn and Kevin Maples voted against it. Lembke proposed the shop for 3067 Village Square Drive. Previously, the business also did not receive the approval of the plan commission, which recommended denial by a 4-3 vote. Alderman Tim Aicher, the council president, made the motion to deny the business at the plan commission meeting. ""My motion was based on how new this particular business is to the state,"" Aicher said. When the business was on the plan commission agenda, it was named Vapes, Juices, and CBD. Lembke changed the name after the feedback she was given. According to city documents, CBD is an active compound (cannabinoid) found in the cannabis plant. CBD does not produce the same psychoactive effects as its more popular relative tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD doesn't produce a high sensation that THC does. Lembke said CBD is already sold in city of Delafield stores. ""Your gas station sells it, your Walmart sells it,"" Lembke said. ""I want to be an educator of people for CBD. People are buying it and they may not be buying the right doses. ... I just want people to learn about it and to be able to help them."" Mayor Kent Attwell said he didn't know much about CBD when the business plan was presented to the plan commission. ""I had no idea,"" Attwell said. ""But since I've called a number of stores around the city of Delafield and there are at least a half dozen that sell the product now. Those are the ones I could find."" Some of the council members were hesitant of the vape products that would be sold in the store. Lembke told the council 10% to 15% of Soothing Senses' products would be vape items. During the plan commission meeting, there were concerns that the smoking aspect of Soothing Senses' products was being downplayed. According to minutes from the meeting, the store would be in close proximity to schools. That was a concern among plan commission members due to the CBD trends found in a younger demographic. After the denial at the common council meeting, Attwell said Lembke could re-apply with different criteria or find a different community. Contact Evan Frank at (262) 361-9138 or evan.frank@jrn.com .

Trump throws support behind 'no brainer' measure to ban burning of American flag,"President Trump threw his support behind a new effort to ban burning the American flag on Saturday, challenging a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that established flag burning was a protected form of speech.

Massive Solar-Storage Project Is Planned for the Nevada Desert,"(Bloomberg) -- NV Energy Inc., the Nevada utility owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., agreed to buy power from three massive solar farms equipped with big batteries in the Nevada desert. The projects mark one of the the biggest expansions of solar and storage ever proposed in the U.S. Combined, they'll produce enough power to supply a city the size of Newark, New Jersey, according to BloombergNEF. Clean-power companies are racing to develop solar projects with batteries capable of providing grids with power after sundown. A key reason is more and more states -- including Nevada -- have committed to ban fossil fuels from power generation over the next several decades, but they'll need more than intermittent solar and wind power to do it. Solar complemented by energy storage can help smooth and extend output from panels to make them operate more like coal or gas plants. ""Solar used to be expensive, and batteries used to be expensive -- and now it's cheap,"" said Jenny Chase, BNEF's lead solar analyst. ""We're going to see new records set very regularly."" It helps that battery prices have fallen sharply. Plus, in some instances it's cheaper to build a solar project with batteries than a new gas-fired power plant, including in parts of the U.S. Southwest . The three projects in Nevada -- by 8minute Solar Energy, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners and EDF Renewables -- will produce about 1,200 megawatts of solar, backed by battery systems capable of storing 2,300 megawatt hours. 8minute is planning a sprawling 300-megawatt solar array with a 540 megawatt-hour lithium-ion storage system north of Las Vegas, according to a company statement. It's expected to begin construction in 2022 on the Moapa River Indian Reservation and be operational the following year if approved by regulators.Quinbrook is building a 690-megawatt solar array and a battery system capable of storing more than 1,400 megawatt hours, according to a separate statement.

New Alaska park bridge aimed at limiting bear encounters,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP)   The National Park Service has completed a project to relieve an Alaska traffic jam. A new elevated bridge and boardwalk across the Brooks River in Katmai National Park and Preserve has replaced a river-level bridge that was often closed to human tourists because it was occupied by locals   brown bears. The replacement for the old floating bridge was more than a decade in the making. ""Each phase of the project (planning, designing, project development, funding, and construction) took time and involved diverse stakeholder groups,"" said park Superintendent Mark Sturm in an email response to questions. Bears catching salmon are a huge draw for the park on the Alaska Peninsula, the arm of land extending from Alaska's southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. The park service estimates that 2,200 brown bears inhabit the park, a number exceeding the people who live on the peninsula. They have six to eight months to eat a year's worth of food and ensure their survival through winter, according to the agency. A popular venue is Brooks Camp, where the park has three bear-viewing platforms. One is at a waterfall where fish concentrate before trying to leap past the barrier and hungry bears to reach natal streams to spawn. Visitors must cross the river to reach all three platforms. The old bridge frequently closed when there was a ""bear jam,"" said Park Service spokeswoman Karen Garthwait. Rangers enforce a 50-yard (46-meter) separation between bears and people. If a bear was on the bridge or close to it in the river, rangers would close the bridge until the bear moved, Garthwait said by email. Bears were not shooed away, Garthwait said. A Park Service mandate to preserve bears' natural feeding areas and behavior gave bears the right of way. The new bridge is 1,200 feet (366 meters) long and varies in height from 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters), depending on topography, Garthwait said, allowing bears to pass below. The cost was $5.6 million. The bridge features bear-proof gates on both ends. Salmon begin arriving in June. Dominant bears take over choice fishing spots. Cubs are vulnerable to be killed and eaten by big males. The most bears typically are seen along the river in mid-July, according to the Park Service. In August, fish are not as concentrated and bears disperse. However, after salmon spawn, weaken and die, bears return in high numbers in September. Bears at that time catch dead and dying fish in the slower-moving lower river, according to the agency. The new bridge will give visitors an additional platform on which to watch wildlife. The Park Service plans a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the bridge on June 29.",environmental issues,AP,center
A child is 'totally unfazed' after being bitten by a 5-foot-long snake that crawled into his home,"A 5-foot-long snake slithered into a Medford, Massachusetts, home. It bit a 9-month-old child. Jenna Lees-Rolfe, the mom, told 7News her son James was ""totally unfazed."" But she remains ""in shock."" She had to wrestle the animal, which was not poisonous, out of her home. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories . Jenna Lees-Rolfe was having a quiet morning at home in Medford, Massachusetts, preparing breakfast for her family, when things took a terrifying turn. As if from out of the blue, a 5-foot-long snake slithered out from under her fridge and bit her 9-month-old son, James, according to the Boston Globe . ""I saw a 5-foot-long snake right there next to him and I screamed,"" Lees-Rolfe told CBS Boston . She watched in horror as the snake bit her son in the leg. But she told 7News that he remained ""totally unfazed"" and not scared at all. Read more: A man was bitten in the face by a snake, and the horrifying moment was captured on a doorbell cam ""I'm still in shock,"" Lees-Rolfe told 7NEWS. ""The snake was in my house next to my 9-month-old. That was the most shocking thing to me."" After getting James into a separate, safe room, she had to get the animal out. Lees-Rolfe wrestled with the animal, ultimately trapping it into a trash can and removing it from the house. Later, Lees-Rolfe had a friend who is a doctor look at the bite mark on James. The boy was deemed OK. ""He has no signs of any kind of poison his bite had zero inflammation,"" Lees-Rolfe told CBS.

'Alcohol was just flooding the aisle': Ridgecrest market has lots to clean after quake,"The tart smell of wine hit customers walking through the doors of the Minit Shop convenience store in Ridgecrest on Thursday afternoon. It had been a few hours since a magnitude 6.4 earthquake   the largest to hit Southern California in nearly two decades   jolted Kern County, and pools of red wine soaked the shop floors. ""Oh, God!"" yelped one customer who saw collapsed shelves of refrigerated drinks in the back of the store. Photos of scattered goods in several Ridgecrest stores spread rapidly across social media on Thursday as news of the quake spread. Authorities in Ridgecrest received dozens of calls for help on Thursday, responding to requests for medical assistance and help with structure fires. But luckily, local officials said, there were no serious injuries reported, just cuts and bruises. The 10:33 a.m. Independence Day quake was centered 10 miles northeast of Ridgecrest, a city of about 29,000 people. Its epicenter was in the remote Searles Valley area near where Inyo, San Bernardino and Kern counties meet. The sparsely populated location of the Searles Valley quake appeared to help mitigate the damage. Javaid Waseem, who owns the Minit Shop with his brother, said it could take days to clean up the store. He had been tidying up for several hours Thursday afternoon. ""This is the first time I've seen this since I moved to California,"" said Waseem, who moved to the state from New York in 2006. ""I've never seen this hard of an earthquake before in this region. I'm glad we are safe, but the damage inside the store   it's going to take time."" Waseem, 45, was at home when the earthquake hit but drove to the store after his brother called asking for help. The brothers shut off the gas lines to the pumps outside, closed the store and called in extra employees to help clean up the mess. The store reopened later in the afternoon, and a steady stream of customers came by to fill their tanks, wary of another quake. At 4 p.m. several aisles were still closed. Hairspray cans, diapers, beer cans and pet food kibbles littered the floor. Workers swept up broken glass and wiped off products to see what they could salvage and put back on the shelves. Bonnie Patterson, a lifelong Ridgecrest resident, stopped in to get gas after seeing police and news vans in town. She said she was reading at home when the earthquake hit but didn't think anything of it. She's used to tremors shaking her hometown, she said. ""Ridgecrest is like an epicenter for earthquakes,"" said Patterson, 46. ""We have little ones all the time, so feeling them   no big deal. But then an aftershock hit and that's when I was like, 'Oh, crap.'"" Some dishes in Patterson's cupboards, items her fireplace mantel and pieces of fine china flew to the floor. As she began to clean, she heard sirens and got calls from coworkers warning her to brace for aftershocks. ""That's when I was like, 'Oh my gosh   I guess I need to take this a little more seriously.'"" When Patterson got to the Minit Mart, where she has been shopping for years, she saw broken bottles all over the floor. ""Alcohol was just flooding the aisle,"" Patterson said. ""The brothers who own it are just the most awesome people. [The] store is a mess, everything is drenched and one owner was still behind the counter smiling and welcoming people in."" She then drove to Walmart, where employees handed out free cases of Gatorade and water earlier in the day. When she got there at 3 p.m., Walmart had closed and was out of supplies. While there, as Patterson chatted with a Walmart employee about where he was when the quake hit, another aftershock rattled the parking lot.

Heavy rains in India's Mumbai cause wall collapse that kills 13,"MUMBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - A wall collapsed on shanties in India's financial capital of Mumbai on Tuesday, killing at least 13 people as a second straight day of heavy rain disrupted rail and air traffic, forcing authorities to declare a public holiday. Mumbai is looking to turn itself into a global financial hub but large parts of the city struggle to cope with annual monsoon rains, as widespread construction and garbage-clogged drains and waterways make it increasingly vulnerable to chaos. The rain brought the wall crashing down on shanties built on a hill slope in Malad, a western suburb, a fire brigade official said. ""Rescue work is still going on,"" the official added. ""So far we have rescued more than a dozen people."" More than 300 mm (11.8 inches) of rain fell over 24 hours in some areas, flooding streets and railway tracks, forcing the suspension of some suburban train services, which millions of commuters ride to work each day. As weather officials forecast intermittent heavy showers and isolated extremely heavy rainfall, municipal authorities said the state government had called a public holiday. ""Rain is expected to remain intense even today,"" they said on social network Twitter. ""We request you to stay indoors unless there's an emergency."" Flights from Mumbai airport, India's second biggest, were also delayed after a SpiceJet flight overshot the runway while landing, an airport spokeswoman said. In the nearby western city of Pune, six people were killed in a similar wall collapse, a fire brigade official said, in the wake of a collapse on Saturday that killed 15. During every monsoon season, which runs from June to September, India experiences fatal incidents of building and wall collapses as rainfall weakens the foundations of poorly-built structures. In 2005, floods killed more than 500 people in Mumbai, the majority in shantytown slums home to more than half the city's population.

'billions' season 4 finale review: the twisty finale reshuffles the deck on the showtime drama (spoilers),"The following contains spoilers about the ""Billions"" season finale. Like a high-stakes card game, ""Billions"" has become especially adept at shuffling the deck, shifting its what's-in-it-for-me alliances in unexpected ways, while playing a long game in terms of double-crosses and jockeying among corporate titans. In the bold third-season finish , that involved transforming two mortal enemies, hedge-fund manager Bobby ""Axe"" Axelrod and former U.S. attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti), into unlikely allies, each seeking to take down former subordinates who had dared go against them. So perhaps inevitably, the fourth-season finale again shook up the playing field, with Axe and Chuck outwitting their opponents, but now poised to turn their guns back on each other, with Chuck's wife Wendy (Maggie Siff) again likely to be caught in the middle. Chuck and Wendy's fraying marriage, a plot that played out across the season, has also created an uncomfortable possibility -- namely, that Wendy appeared to be experiencing an attraction to Axe, with whom she has always been extremely close strictly professional terms. Wendy's decision to head over to Axe's place to spend the night only heightened the dangerous game that the writers are playing, but they wisely stepped back from that abyss, at least for now. The rest of the hour, fortunately, exhibited the best that this Showtime drama has to offer, with Axe demonstrated just how ruthless he could be in his quest to take down Taylor (Asia Kate Dillon), which included selling out his girlfriend, Rebecca (Nina Arianda), sacrificing their relationship on that altar. Similarly, Chuck outmaneuvered his former protégé Bryan (Toby Leonard Moore), in the process neutralizing not only him but his boss, the Attorney General (Clancy Brown), in an elaborate deception that Chuck hatched with his father (Jeffrey DeMunn), who might be the show's most utterly amoral character, which is saying something. In a sense, ""Billions"" appears to be circling back to its roots, understanding that the partnership Axe and Chuck forged out of necessity could never last, and that it was only a matter of time before they turned on each other. Wendy's confusion only risks making the seemingly inevitable showdown more personal, but it has always seemed like this is a Thunderdome situation, where two men enter, only one leaves, and neither comes away unscarred. ""Billions"" wasn't conceived for what might be called the Trump era of television, but the show has felt perfectly calibrated to it, with money and the levers of government as the ultimate paths to power. Thanks to the cast and sharp writing, it's great fun to watch as a soap opera, while simultaneously operating on a more elevated track. The entire season, in fact, has been about playing angles and calling in favors by people who play Monopoly with real buildings and seldom worry much about collateral damage. It's a world of privilege where winning is the goal, but victories are always sweeter when they come directly at someone else's expense. Throwing Axe and Chuck together offered a clever means to prolong the seemingly inevitable collision, but the series now appears to be squarely back on that road. ""No one's left standing,"" Chuck muses near the end of the episode. That sounds like one of those lines that might be worth filing away for when ""Billions"" nears its end game.",politics,The Washington Post,left
Nurse denied marathon world record -- because she wasn't wearing a skirt,"A woman who wanted to break the Guinness World Record for running a marathon dressed as a nurse has been told her successful attempt does not count -- because she was wearing scrubs and pants, rather than a skirt. Jessica Anderson, a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, ran the city's marathon last Sunday in the outfit she wears at work. But she was told beforehand by Guinness World Records that she would need to wear a blue and white dress, apron and a traditional nurse's cap for her effort to be valid, Britain's Press Association reported. Full-body scrubs are too close to the organization's definition of a doctor's costume, officials added. ""Their definition is just so outdated,"" Anderson told the magazine Runner's World. ""Some of the nurses I work with do wear dresses but mostly we wear scrubs or a tunic and trousers. I've certainly never seen a male nurse wearing a dress to work."" ""I'm sure Guinness World Records don't intend to cause offence but it would be nice if they decided to revise their criteria instead of reinforcing old gender stereotypes,"" she added. Anderson had asked the organization to reconsider, but her request was denied. They have since said they would review their rules. ""Inclusiveness and respect are values that Guinness World Records holds extremely dear, and while we always need to ensure we can differentiate between categories, it is quite clear that this record title is long overdue a review, which we will conduct as a priority in the coming days,"" the body said in a statement. CNN has contacted Anderson for comment. Anderson would have claimed the record had her costume been accepted; her time was 3 hours, 8 minutes and 22 seconds, beating the previous record by 32 seconds. The run is one of the world's most famous events and receives hundreds of thousands of applicants each year. More than 400,000 applied to join this year's marathon, setting a new record, organizers said. But last Sunday's race was not free from controversy, with organizers investigating claims that runners towards the end of the pack were called ""fat,"" ""slow"" and told to hurry up by contractors. Anderson, who was worked at the London hospital for seven years, set a fundraising target of £500 ($660) for her race but smashed the target, with many contributors donating money after the race, having heard about the decision. By Sunday morning, her fundraising page showed contributors had pledged £2,400. ""We have previously used the charity fund to buy equipment for the ward such as dementia friendly clocks and signage, a bladder scanner and some furnishings for the staff room and day rooms,"" she wrote on her page.",health,CNN,left
faulty wiring blamed for electrocuting boys in solano co. irrigation canal,"Attorneys are blaming faulty, sloppy wiring for an electrified irrigation canal bridge that killed two teenage boys earlier this year. RELATED: 2 teens electrocuted trying to rescue dog from Dixon canal Jacob Hourmouzus, 17, of Elk Grove and Jacob Schneider, 17, of Dixon, were walking with two other friends and one of the boy's dog along an irrigation ditch just west of Dixon in Solano County. During that stroll, they crossed a metal bridge over the irrigation ditch and the dog fell into the water. Hourmouzus and Schneider jumped into the water to save the dog. When they grabbed back onto the bridge for support, they were electrocuted. Schneider's cousin Kelby Holland then jumped into the canal to drag the two boys out of the water. RELATED: Solano Irrigation District holds special meeting following death of teens in Dixon canal The Solano Irrigation District (SID) oversees and is in charge of that canal and bridge. ABC10 learned new information about what happened via two complaints for damages, which attorneys for the boys' families filed Thursday. Daniel Wilcoxen represents Hourmouzus' family and Robert Buccola represents Schneider's family, including the cousin. The attorneys said wiring around the metal bridge's infrastructure was not grounded, meaning any excess electricity would run not into the ground   as it should   but into the bridge, electrifying it. ""You've got to understand the kind of a trap that was laid there,"" Wilcoxen said. ""That bridge was electrified for a long period of time."" While the attorneys aren't claiming the Solano Irrigation District had any intent to cause harm, they are saying that the SID was negligent in installing such slipshod wiring. ""The biggest concern we have now is, what other facilities at SID are wired similarly, and we have those inquiries out,"" Buccola said. ""We've been assured by counsel for SID that any other facility wired that way would be immediately rectified."" The boys' families want more than a fix of faulty wiring, however. ""One of the things that both families have in mind is that we won't resolve this case until there are protocols that make this kind of accident impossible to occur in the future,"" Buccola said. The families are also seeking compensation for funeral, burial and attorney expenses, as well as damages for emotional impact and loss of life. The parents said any money awarded that's left over after covering expenses will go toward philanthropic efforts in the boys' communities. Their deaths left the communities   and families - heartbroken. ""These are their oldest sons, the ones looked up to by their other siblings, and you've just taken away a child when he's in his senior year in high school,"" Wilcoxen said. In a response to ABC10's request for comment, the Solano Irrigation District spokesperson provided this statement: ""The Solano Irrigation District has cooperated fully with the Sheriff's investigation into the circumstances surrounding this accident. Because the investigation has not been completed, and with the pending litigation, we are unable to comment further."" On April 3, two days after the fatal incident, Solano Irrigation District board members consulted with SID's attorneys in a closed meeting. ""This has been really hard on the district, the community,"" board spokesperson Janet Zimmerman told ABC10 News that day. ""This is a very small community. People know each other. Employees of the district know the families. Some of them knew the boys, and it's wrenching. It's heart-wrenching, and everybody feels terrible. It's a very sad story and a horrible accident."" Buccola and Wilcoxen said the families are asking for privacy. They also want to see changes to bring about more accountability for electrical wiring and construction in SID infrastructure   as well as the infrastructure of irrigation districts throughout the state, since those entities are self-governing and without the strict oversight of the construction industry.

Kaiser Unveils Plan For Massive National Headquarters 'Thrive Center' In Oakland,"OAKLAND (KPIX)   Kaiser unveiled the plans for its massive new national headquarters on Monday. Dubbed the Thrive Center, it will span nearly 1.7 million square feet. That is more than the Salesforce Tower, but it will stand about half as tall. It is a huge building, and it is an even bigger deal for Oakland. ""The word of the day is big,"" declared Mayor Libby Schaaf. The project is so big a lot of Oaklanders spent Monday just trying to imagine what's about to land here between Broadway and Telegraph. ""This is amazing,"" said Oakland resident Ben Lang, looking at the renderings. ""I've lived in the city for 40 years and I've never seen anything like this."" The big building is the result of a big decision from Kaiser. ""At the end of the day we can think of no better place to stay than Oakland California. So we're here,"" said Kaiser Permanente CEO Bernard Tyson. The health giant, Oakland's largest employer, will not only stay in Oakland, it will consolidate staff now spread across seven downtown office buildings, in one brand new national and regional headquarters. ""We, in fact, have projected that we will save, annually, about $60 million,"" Tyson explained. It also means Oakland will have 1.6 million square feet of office space available when Kaiser moves across town, and Mayor Schaaf was already inviting businesses to stake their claim on that space Monday, doing some bragging about Oakland's current desirability. ""We all remember several years ago when Kaiser was even thinking about relocating its hospital outside of Oakland,"" Schaaf said. ""So today is such a great day."" So it's not just the biggest building in town, but a something of an exclamation point in a downtown where big things seem to be happening all over the place. ""Cranes everywhere, new buildings, new housing, new structures everywhere,"" says Oakland resident Leshia Gwen. ""I notice even the old structures are getting face lifts. Oakland is thriving."" Kaiser expects to break ground on the Thrive Center next year, with completion expected in 2023.",health,KPIX,left

new york activists go on hunger strike to advocate for ending solitary confinement,"A group of New York activists are going on a hunger strike through the end of the state's legislative session to advocate for ending the practice of solitary confinement. Solitary confinement survivors and activists launched the #HaltSolitary hunger strike on Thursday to push lawmakers in Albany to vote on a bill that advocates say offers more humane alternatives to solitary confinement. At least 16 activists are said to have joined in the hunger strike on behalf of prisoner rights. The strike will last until the end of the session on June 19, or until the bill is voted on and signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). HUNGER STRIKE DAY 1: @jchausow & I join 15 others from @NYCAIC & @VOCALNewYork in a hunger strike to demand the passage of the #HALTsolitary Act. The bill has the support to pass. We need to @AndreaSCousins & @CarlHeastie to allow a vote on the bill & for @NYGovCuomo to sign it. pic.twitter.com/dGIiqA0Nym - Dave George (@davidgeorge265) June 13, 2019 Activists say they are also planning to to hold a strike outside Cuomo's Manhattan office on Friday morning . The bill, titled the Humane Alternatives to Long Term Solitary Confinement Act , would end long-term isolated confinement, limiting an individual from spending more than 15 consecutive or 20 days total in isolated confinement in a 60-day period. It would also ban isolated confinement for any person under 21 or over 55 years old, or anyone with mental or physical disabilities. Victor Pate, a campaign organizer, said he was held in solitary confinement for two years. From his experience, Pate said prisoners in solitary often don't get fed, and the hunger strikes brings awareness to their treatment. ""We are doing this strike to bring attention to the lack of urgency shown by the legislature,"" Pate said in a statement. Nick Encalada-Malinowski, a campaign director for VOCAL-NY and hunger strike participant, said elected officials don't see incarcerated people ""as fully human."" ""Every elected official needs to be asking themselves this question: Would I allow someone I love to suffer the torture of solitary confinement? If the answer is no, they must pass the bill,"" he said in a statement. Cuomo was not immediately available for comment Thursday night. A spokesperson for Cuomo responded to local outlet Gothamist by pointing out a portion of the governor's 2019 Justice Agenda that directed the state's Department of Corrections to speed up solitary confinement by building more housing and expanding therapeutic programming. ""We of course remain engaged with the legislature on any additional reforms that can be operationally and fiscally implemented,"" spokesman Jason Conwall told the Gothamist. The push to end solitary confinement has seen renewed attention in recent days after Democratic firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) called for President Trump 's former campaign manager Paul Manafort to be released from solitary confinement. Ocasio-Cortez has frequently taken aim at Rikers Island prison - which is located in her district - for inhumane conditions, calling the practice ""torture"" and a ""human rights violation.""",health,NBC News,left
See how this YouTube star turned her Tesla Model 3 into a pickup truck,"Elon Musk has promised to unveil Tesla's first-ever electric pickup truck by the end of this summer. But at least one Tesla fan was too eager to wait   so, she made her own. Simone Giertz is a Swedish-born YouTube host known mostly for making comical online videos chronicling her attempts to build what she calls ""sh---y robots."" Giertz, whose channel has over 1.6 million followers, regularly builds robots that perform everyday tasks less than adequately, like a helmet that sloppily brushes your teeth or an alarm clock that wakes you up with a rubber hand smacking your face. But on Tuesday, Giertz posted a new video to YouTube that shows her latest engineering effort   converting a Tesla Model 3 sedan into a pickup truck   and it actually appears to be a success. The 31-minute video shows Giertz, along with mechanic Marcos Ramirez , designer Laura Kampf and car refurbisher Rich Benoit (of the YouTube channel ""Rich Rebuilds""), removing the electric sedan's rear window and literally cutting through the Model 3 frame to remove the back end of its roof. Giertz and her team of engineers and designers then strip out the Tesla's backseat and trunk in order to install a pickup bed in the now-open back of the car. Giertz says they spent over a year planning the project, which included buying a new Model 3 (which has a base price of $35,000) from Tesla. ""One of the initial designs we had was to essentially strip everything from the midway and back, and just put in a flatbed,"" Giertz told Wired, ""But I didn't like the look of that. So we decided to salvage as much of the back half as possible and try to build it into more of an El Camino . pickup truck,"" referring to the famous Chevrolet model. After adding a metal frame of reinforcement beams that double as a roof rack to the pickup bed, along with floodlights strapped to the top of the car, Giertz dubs the resulting vehicle ""Truckla."" In the video, Giertz notes that, when she began this project, she wasn't sure ""if this was going to be the smartest or the most stupid thing I'm ever going to do."" Giertz also makes it clear that this project is more than just a YouTube stunt, as she plans to drive the converted pickup truck, which she says is currently ""usable"" but it will be ""fully drivable"" by July, after she makes some more minor improvements to the car's body and wiring. She even calls the ""Truckla"" her ""absolute dream car."" Giertz even produced a fake, nearly two-minute car commercial for ""Truckla,"" which describes the vehicle as ""the truck the world didn't know it was waiting for"" and advertises the pickup as ""available nowhere."" Musk and Tesla have not yet commented on Giertz's creation. The company did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment. But, the electric automaker is reportedly still moving ahead with plans to reveal its own Tesla pickup truck as soon as in the next few months (though, when the truck would actually go on sale is still unknown ). Meanwhile, Musk has been busy setting ambitious goals for his company's planned pickup, including saying earlier this month that Tesla's electric pickup ""will be a better truck"" than Ford's best-selling F-150 truck models with a starting price under $50,000.

Wisconsin man guilty of not reporting fatal Zion hit-and-run,"After more than a day of deliberations, a Lake County jury has found a Kenosha man guilty of two felonies in a Zion hit-and-run crash that killed a 19-year-old and seriously injured the victim's friend in July 2017. Dennis C. Russell Jr., 35, accused of driving the car that killed 19-year-old Randall Lee Harrison Jr. of Pleasant Prairie and seriously injured Harrison's friend, was found guilty Monday morning of failure to report an accident involving death and failure to report an accident causing injury. Lake County Associate Judge George Strickland set a sentencing hearing for Russell July 19. Assistant State's Attorneys Danielle Puscucci said Russell faces a sentencing range of four to 15 years, but due to prior felony convictions, it could be extended up to 30 years based on the judge's discretion. Pascucci said the family of Harrison was ""happy with the verdict and we are happy the family was able to find closure."" Closing arguments in the trial concluded late Thursday afternoon, and the jury deliberated into Thursday night and all day Friday before reaching it's verdict Monday. Police and prosecutors said the crash occurred after midnight Oct. 21, 2017, on Green Bay Road south of 9th Street. In closing arguments, Pascucci said Russell knew he struck the two men, killing Harrison Jr. of Pleasant Prairie and leaving a friend with injuries he still suffers from today. Prosecutors said the impact of the crash threw Harrison 130 feet through the air, and knocked him out of his socks and shoes, which were found on opposite sides of Green Bay Road. ""He didn't even pull over, didn't even pull his car over after he ran over these kids,"" Pascucci said in closing arguments. Pascucci said instead that Russell, who had been drinking prior to the crash, pulled into the parking lot of Fritz's Corner in Zion, drove behind a large commercial truck, put the convertible's top down and turned off its lights before leaving the lot a short while later. She said he later he left the car, stripped of his belongings and its license plates, in a cornfield near a golf course where it was discovered and through its VIN number found to be rgistered to Russell. Experts also testified that the defendant's DNA was found on the steering wheel of the damaged car, and DNA found on the hood of the car was found to be a probable match for Harrison. Defense attorney Jeff Facklam told the jury that Russell was driving in a very dark rural area with a posted 55-mile-an-hour speed limit, and assumed he hit a deer or some other animal. He said the defense did not contest that Russell was driving the 2004 Chrysler Sebring that struck the two men, but he said that to be convicted of the charge against him, the state had to prove Russell knew he had hit a person and didn't stop to render aid or call police within a half hour. Authorities said that Harrison and his friend were riding a mountain bike and a large, low-lying, Big-Wheel-style three-wheel bike tethered together with an extension cord along Green Bay Road. Facklam said that was not something a driver would have expected in that area and time, and that while the crash was a tragedy, with the low visibility conditions and going 55 miles an hour, Russell wouldn't have had the time to realize he had hit someone. He said the crash occurred in a rural area of the county, where crashes involving deer and other animals are common. During the trial, prosecutors showed videos of Russell drinking beers and shots at bars in Illinois and Wisconsin prior to the crash. He was not arrested until months after the crash, so sobriety tests were never performed. jrnewton@tribpub.com Twitter @jimnewton5",crime,Chicago Tribune,center
struggling apple valley golf course targeted for redevelopment,"Yet another metro golf course is targeted for redevelopment. The owner of Apple Valley Golf Course is asking the city for a land-use change that could make way for mixed-density housing. Joel Watrud has put his 23-acre course up for sale and is requesting three amendments to the city's comprehensive plan that would guide the land use from private recreation to residential. Peter Coyle, a land-use attorney representing Watrud, said at Wednesday night's planning commission meeting that the golf course   like many across the metro area   is ""struggling to the point of failing."" ""And it becomes necessary in this case for a family that has owned and operated the course for decades to finally throw in the towel,"" he said. The course is losing money and ""it's time to find another use for the property,"" he added. The list of defunct golf courses that have been developed or are slated to be has grown in recent years. It includes Mississippi Dunes in Cottage Grove , Thompson Oaks in West St. Paul and Hillcrest Golf Club in St. Paul . In Eagan, two former golf courses   Carriage Hills and Parkview   are now bustling residential neighborhoods. HOUSING PROPOSED ON SITE Apple Valley City Planner Tom Lovelace said in order for a land-use change the property must be able to support the proposed use and fit with the surrounding area and the city's overall plans. Apple Valley Golf Course, a nine-hole course located at the northwest corner of 140th Street West and Garden View Drive, is framed by single-family homes to the north and west, single-family, two-family and townhomes to the south, and townhomes and private open space to the east. Watrud's request would re-designate 14.5 acres for medium-density residential (six to 12 units per acre); eight acres for high-density residential (12-plus units per acre); and a half-acre for low-density residential (two to six units per acre). Lovelace noted that an 80-foot wide easement for an underground gas pipeline cuts through the property from the southeast to the northwest, meaning that about 2.5 acres probably won't be developable because gas companies have policies to not allow buildings or landscaping within the easement. PROPOSAL'S REMAINING STEPS Wednesday's discussion included a public hearing on the request. Several neighbors spoke in opposition of the course being built out, with a few suggesting the city should buy the property and keep it green space. Excelsior-based Synergy Land Company is marketing the property for sale. A listing on the company's website does not include a purchase price.

The earliest the council could consider the request would be Aug. 8. If the council were to green-light the land-use change, it would then go before the Metropolitan Council for possible approval. Coyle said Watrud has tried to market the property to developers previously but they all wanted to know what plan to bring to the city so it ""has a chance of being approved."" ""And that's what the comp-plan process is supposed to be,"" Coyle said. ""It's supposed to be for what the city envisions for the property in the future.""",health,Miami Herald,left
US appeals court sides with Trump in lawsuit involving hotel,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP)   A federal appeals court has ordered the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump of illegally profiting off the presidency through his luxury Washington hotel, handing Trump a significant legal victory on Wednesday. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned the ruling of a federal judge in Maryland who said the lawsuit could move forward. The state of Maryland and the District of Columbia sued in 2017, claiming Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at his luxury Washington hotel. The provision prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval. The 4th Circuit found the two jurisdictions lack standing to pursue their claims against the president, and granted a petition for a rare writ of mandamus, directing U.S. District Court Judge Peter Messitte to dismiss the lawsuit. Trump heralded the decision in a tweet, saying, ""Word just out that I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt."" Trump tweeted that he doesn't make money but loses ""a fortune"" by serving as president. Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, called the decision ""a complete victory."" ""The decision states that there was no legal standing to bring this lawsuit in the first place,"" Sekulow said a statement. ""This latest effort at Presidential harassment has been dismissed with prejudice."" During oral arguments before the panel in March, lawyers for Maryland and the District said Trump's status as president is a driving factor for foreign and domestic government officials to stay at his hotel. Just blocks from the White House, the iconic Old Post Office quickly became a hot spot for lobbyists and foreign officials after it reopened in October 2016 as the Trump International Hotel. A public relations firm working for Saudi Arabia spent nearly $270,000 on food and rooms. The Philippine and Kuwaiti embassies have also had parties there. Maryland and the District claim they have suffered harm because more people would stay at hotels in their jurisdictions if they weren't eager to curry favor with the president by staying at his hotel. Trump's legal team argued that Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine   both Democrats   lack authority to sue the president in his official capacity. Trump's lawyers also argued that the emoluments clause only bars compensation made in connection with services provided in his official capacity or in ""an employment-type relationship"" with a foreign or domestic government. The 4th Circuit's decision to hear the unusual mid-case appeal put the lawsuit on hold before deadlines to respond to subpoenas issued in December seeking tax returns, receipts and other records from more than 30 entities, including 13 Trump businesses and the federal agency that oversees the lease for Trump's hotel. It appears likely the panel's ruling will not be the end of the case. Racine has said that if the panel ruled against Maryland and the District, the legal team would seriously consider asking for a rehearing before the full 4th Circuit. He also said it wouldn't surprise him if the case ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for Frosh's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Racine's office said a statement would be forthcoming. All three judges on the panel were nominated by Republican presidents: Paul Niemeyer, by George H.W. Bush; Dennis Shedd, by George W. Bush, and Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum, by Trump. A similar case brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats in the District of Columbia's federal court also deals with the idea that Trump is using the presidency for his personal profit, but that case is uniquely different in that the Congress is specifically mentioned in the emoluments clause itself. On Monday, the Justice Department petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the D.C. appeals court and asked for a stay on the 37 subpoenas issued in that case. ___ Associated Press writers Tami Abdollah in Washington and Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
Honduran man dies in ICE custody at Texas facility,"A 30-year-old Honduran migrant died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody Sunday, the government confirmed. Yimi Alexis Balderramos-Torres was found unresponsive in his dormitory at the Houston Contract Detention Facility on Sunday, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security. Balderramos-Torres was then taken to a hospital in Humble, Texas, where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death remains undetermined and an autopsy is scheduled. ""Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay,"" the DHS said in a statement Monday. ""All ICE detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care."" Balderramos-Torres is the sixth person to die in ICE custody since the start of the fiscal year, which began in October, the DHS said. He was denied entry into the United States on May 17 after border agents found him ""inadmissible"" in El Paso, Texas, and sent him to Mexico, the department said. On May 27, Balderramos-Torres ""again entered the country illegally"" and was detained by local law enforcement during a traffic stop, then transferred to ICE custody June 6, according to the agency. Migrant detention centers have drawn renewed scrutiny amid reports of poor living conditions for detainees. A group of lawyers told The Associated Press earlier this month that young children and teenagers were denied access to showers for days or even weeks, provided inadequate food, suffered flu outbreaks and subjected to prolonged periods of detention at a facility in Clint, Texas. Almost 300 migrant children were removed from the center last week. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Monday that after visiting two immigration detention facilities in Texas she learned that Customs and Border Patrol officers told detained women to ""drink out of the toilets."" ""After I forced myself into a cell w/ women & began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare'   waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc.,"" she said on Twitter. ""Tell me what about that is due to a 'lack of funding?'"" In an internal report prepared by Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General and obtained by NBC News, inspectors noted during a May 7 tour of a border station in the El Paso sector that only four showers were available for 756 immigrants , more than half of the immigrants were being held outside, and immigrants inside were being kept in cells maxed out at more than five times their capacity. Medical concerns were also rising during early May, the report found. Agents reported taking sick migrants to the hospital five times a day, treating 75 immigrants for lice in a single day and trying to quarantine outbreaks of flu, chickenpox and scabies.",health,Associated Press,center
Investigators crack cold case murder of South Dakota woman,"RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP)   The murder of a pharmacist who was raped and strangled in her home in a South Dakota city more than half a century ago has been solved with the use of DNA technology and genealogy databases, police said. Investigators believe Eugene Carroll Field killed 60-year-old Gwen Miller in 1968 when he was a 25-year-old living in Rapid City, Detective Wayne Keefe said at a news conference Monday. He said there was enough evidence to charge Field with first-degree murder, but that he died in 2009. It is ""a little surreal"" to finally identify the killer after 51 years and up to 5,000 hours of work, Keefe said. ""Today, there's a slight celebratory mood because the case has been solved,"" Police Chief Karl Jegeris said. ""But I assure you, the fact of how horrific this crime was wears heavy on each and every one of our hearts."" Miller had no children and worked as a pharmacist at a Rapid City hospital. After she didn't show up to work Feb. 29, 1968, two co-workers went to her house, where they found a broken window in the back, Keefe said. The coroner found she had been raped, suffered broken neck and rib bones, and died by strangulation. Last year, Keefe sent a DNA profile of semen from the crime scene to forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick, who used public genealogy websites to identify Field's brother. Keefe then searched for the family's name in old phone directories to determine that the suspect had lived near the victim. Field was a ticketing agent for Western Airlines at the Rapid City airport, which Miller frequented. Keefe also determined that Field had rented a room in the house next door to Miller for several months in 1963. The detective interviewed two women who had been married to Field. Both said he had abused them. He also contacted Field's brother and only sibling, who provided a DNA sample that showed a 99.23 percent probability of being from a full sibling of the killer. Field has no known connections to any other cold case and does not seem to have previously been a suspect in Miller's death, Keefe said. The Associated Press was not immediately able to locate Field's survivors Tuesday, and police declined to provide contact information. Kay Miller-Temple, of Grand Forks, North Dakota, said her great-aunt was a ""very independent and confident"" person, especially for a single woman in the mid-1900s. She said her family members, who came from across South Dakota and as far away as Arizona to attend the news conference, wanted their experience to give hope to other families with cold cases. ""The family of Gwen Vivian Miller offers you our gratitude and our appreciation,"" she said through tears. ""Thank you for giving us an answer.""",crime,Associated Press,center

NYPD trial in Eric Garner's death could be longest in department's history,"Nearly two dozen witnesses may be called in the NYPD trial of the cop accused of using a deadly chokehold on Eric Garner, the Daily News has learned. Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo is facing department charges for using a banned maneuver, killing Garner on a Staten Island street on July 17, 2014. The Civilian Complaint Review Board said Thursday it plans to call 17 witnesses to the stand in Police Headquarters, with another 33 possible. Lawyers for Pantaleo said they intend to call 22 witnesses. If that happens, the trial, set to begin in May, could be one of the longest departmental trials in history. The judge, Rosemary Maldonado can cut the list down to police officers only, and eliminate the civilians. The CCRB and Pantaleo's attorney Stuart London have filed motions in the case, but those filings will likely never see the light of day because of the de Blasio administration's position on police disciplinary records. City Hall believes state Civil Rights Law, section 50-a bars releases of any such records. Civil rights advocates disagree. Highlighting the administrative secrecy surrounding the now four-year-old case, the lawyers and Maldonado held an extended off-the-record conversation Thursday out of earshot of the packed gallery. ""We still see that the NYPD is covering up,"" said Garner's mother Gwen Carr. ""It's not just Pantaleo. It's the other officers who (were) involved. We want all of them to stand trial. We want all of them to be fired."" Garner, 43, was selling loose cigarettes before police approached him. When they tried to arrest him, he said he was tired of police harassment, threw his hands up and tried to back away. The cops wrestled Garner to the ground , and while he was in a chokehold and Garner said, ""I can't breathe"" 11 times, lost consciousness and died. Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said Pantaleo   who was cleared of criminal charges by a grand jury   shouldn't face a departmental trial. ""The basic facts of this case are that the officers were sent to arrest Mr. Garner on complaints from the community,"" Lynch said. ""He had been warned to cease his illegal activities the week before and chose to ignore the warning, so letting him go was not an option."" Lynch said Garner refused to cooperate and pushed cops away. ""The officers involved did not hit with their fists or batons, nor did they draw their weapons to gain compliance,"" Lynch explained. ""Mr. Garner was taken to the ground using the minimum amount of force by employing a maneuver taught in the police academy. Unfortunately, Mr. Garner's extremely poor health and severely compromised cardiovascular system resulted in his tragic demise. Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo did nothing wrong."" The NYPD and the CCRB did not return requests for comment.",legal arguments,New York Daily News,left
"Help pouring in to Trona after earthquakes, but officials warn recovery will take time","Less than a week after twin earthquakes rocked the core of the tiny town of Trona, Calif., Ronnie Tolbert walked out of a community meeting and got straight to work. The longtime resident helped an Arizona man unload a van full of supplies, which would be delivered to a local church for distribution. Tolbert, 60, said she's in awe of the help coming from out of state to Trona , a place few had heard of before last week's major quakes. What's less surprising, she said, is the goodwill that has come from within the small town of about 1,800 people. Since the first earthquake, measuring magnitude 6.4, struck on July 4 , neighbors have spent long hours helping one another as resources from outside communities and local officials have trickled in. On Wednesday morning, about 900 residents gathered at Trona High School for a community meeting convened by local officials   three days after a similar meeting in nearby Ridgecrest. Though it took a few days for additional help to arrive, officials and volunteers are now out in full force, Tolbert said. Representatives from the California Department of Emergency Services, the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, the county Land Use Department, the Red Cross and other agencies were at the 10 a.m. meeting to hear locals' concerns, said Robert Lovingood, chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors. A full recovery, though, will take more time. ""I certainly think it's going to be a while,"" Lovingood said. ""We're going to continue until everything is back and functioning."" County officials have brought portable showers and bathrooms to Trona, established a shuttle service between the town and Ridgecrest, opened commodity distribution centers and made counselors available at the local high school. Federal and state funding is beginning to roll in. Power was restored   again   a day after Friday's 7.1 quake , residents said. Water just came back on Wednesday morning.​ ""It's steamrolling to where we're starting to get a lot more resources we need to help rebuild,"" said resident Jonathan Schmid, 36, who works at the Searles Valley Mineral Plant. Schmid has become an informal liaison between his neighbors and county officials. He wakes up daily at 6 a.m. to unload and distribute donations and puts his head to rest after midnight, he said. When the quake hit these Trona families, 'everything came tumbling down' » ""It's still hectic,"" he said. ""We take care of our own."" At the town hall, residents expressed concern for Trona's elderly and disabled and their medical needs, Schmid said. And because the town lies on the border of Inyo and San Bernardino counties, he's worried not everyone is getting the same level of attention. Tolbert said many residents are still focused on cleanup and getting their homes cleared by safety officials. Many houses have been red-tagged   declared unsafe to inhabit   and residents have resorted to sleeping in their yards. Tolbert herself sleeps on mattresses on her driveway after her home was severely damaged. Those who can get into their homes find shelter under tables or away from walls. Some have left the town entirely. Still, Tolbert said the experience has brought everyone closer. ""I now know things about my town I did not know,"" she said. ""I am a more aware neighbor, honest to God."" alejandra.reyesvelarde@latimes.com Twitter: @r_valejandra",environmental issues,Los Angeles Times,left
"Supreme Court won't strip federal agencies of all power to interpret regulations, a top priority of conservatives","WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court denied the conservative legal movement something it has long sought Wednesday, refusing to strip federal agencies of the power to interpret ambiguous regulations. The decision was unanimous because while upholding agencies' authority, the justices defined new limits. Deference ""is sometimes appropriate and sometimes not,"" Associate Justice Elena Kagan said in her opinion. ""Deference can apply only when a regulation is genuinely ambiguous,"" Kagan said, and ""the agency's construction of its rule must still be reasonable."" But when those and other conditions are met, she said, courts must accept agency interpretations. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch went further in a 42-page concurrence, labeling the decision ""more of a stay of execution than a pardon."" He and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh said they would have overruled the high court's precedent on agency deference. ""The doctrine emerges maimed and enfeebled   in truth, zombified,"" Gorsuch said. More: Supreme Court rules for sex offender in child pornography case testing power of judges, juries And Chief Justice John Roberts warned that the court's refusal to overrule its precedent does not signal the same treatment for another target of conservatives: so-called ""Chevron deference,"" in which courts are supposed to bend to agency interpretations of laws enacted by Congress. That precedent, therefore, remains on the ropes. The ruling is important because agencies run by unelected bureaucrats make decisions all the time about regulations on the environment, the workplace, food and drugs, and other matters affecting millions of Americans. Challengers wanted that power left to federal trial judges when regulations get challenged in court. Under Supreme court precedents from 1945 and 1997, courts are encouraged to defer to administrative agencies with expertise the judges lack. The specific case before the justices challenged the Department of Veterans Affairs' refusal to pay retroactive disability benefits to a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War with post-traumatic stress disorder. But it rose to the high court's attention only because it was a stalking horse for a much bigger issue. The unanimous 1997 decision in Auer v. Robbins upholding agencies' clout was written by the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia , who over the next two decades grew to despise it. He once told his friend and colleague, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, that Auer was ""one of the worst opinions in the history of this country."" ""Nino,"" Thomas has said in recounting the story, ""you wrote it."" Defending agency deference during oral argument in March, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer cited ""hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of interpretive regulations"" that bureaucrats are best able to define. By way of example, Breyer noted a Food and Drug Administration regulation concerns ""a single new active moiety, which consists of a previously approved moiety, joined by a non-ester covalent bond to a lysine group."" ""Do you know how much I know about that?"" Breyer quipped. Tongue in cheek, Kagan answered his question in a footnote to her opinion, complete with references to molecules, ions, esters, salts, chelates and clathrates. More: Supreme Court's Top Cases of 2019 The case was closely watched by both conservatives and liberals because eliminating agency deference over regulations is considered a stepping stone to the more controversial change: stripping agencies of the power to interpret ambiguous laws passed by Congress . Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the high court does not overrule itself often   about once a year and considerably less than in the past. But last year, it struck down both a 1977 decision that allowed public employee unions to collect fees from non-members and a 1992 ruling that allowed retailers to sell goods tax-free beyond state borders . This year, the court has overruled precedents on states' immunity from being sued in other states and the requirement that property owners challenge government takings in state court before reaching federal court.

"Best States To Retire: Where Do Pennsylvania, New Jersey, And Delaware Rank?","PHILADELPHIA (CBS)   Retirement means you no longer have to worry about work but it may bring new questions like where should you settle at. A new study is making it easier to decide by ranking all 50 states. Check out the list to see where Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware ranked. Bankrate's 2019 ""Best and worst states for retirement"" study looked at affordability, weather, crime rate, culture, and wellness. The study found Nebraska to be the best state for retirement because of affordability, low crime, culture and wellness. Nebraskans can camp near Chimney Rock State Park, shop and dine near the Heartland of America Park and Fountain in Omaha or snap pics of the floral designs in Lincoln's Sunken Gardens. Those who want to hit the road in retirement have a nice central point to visit national parks in the West, head north to Mount Rushmore National Park or east on I-80 into the Midwest. Maryland was ranked the worst due to the high cost of living and a high crime rate. Delaware came in 32nd place, Pennsylvania landed in 34th and New Jersey took the 42nd spot.

Viking Burial Ships Uncovered in 'Sensational' Archaeological Find,"Archaeologists have discovered two Viking burial ships in the Swedish municipality of Uppsala. A find of this type is rare in the country. In fact, only around ten discoveries of this kind have been made to date in the Scandinavian nation, according to researchers. ""This is a unique excavation, the last burial ship was examined 50 years ago,"" Anton Seiler, an archeologist who works with several Swedish museums, told The Local . The two vessels which Saeiler describes as a ""sensational"" find were excavated near the grounds of a vicarage in the village of Gamla Uppsala last fall. These types of burials, where individuals were placed in full-sized boats, were not available to the common folk. They are thought to have been reserved for individuals with high status. ""It is a small group of people who were buried in this way,"" Seiler said. ""You can suspect that they were distinguished people in the society of the time since burial ships in general are very rare."" The archaeologists only found the remains of one individual. However, as is common with other burial ships in the region, this person was laid to rest beside several objects including weapons, shields and a comb they may have been given to take into the afterlife. The team also found the remains of animals, including a horse and a dog. Although it remains unclear when this burial took place, most grave ships of this type originate from the Viking Age (793 1066 A.D.) of Scandinavian history or the era immediately preceding it, which is known as the Vendel Period (500-793 A.D.) In recent months, researchers also discovered another ship associated with a burial practice in the Scandinavian region. Archaeologists from the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) discovered a huge 66-foot-long Viking ship using an advanced new ground-penetrating radar technique in √òstfold County, southeastern Norway. The radar data that the NIKU team collected indicated that the ship was once embedded within a large burial mound which was gradually destroyed by farming activity over time. Surprisingly, the ship appeared to have survived totally intact, despite lying just 20 inches below the topsoil. ""This find is incredibly exciting as we only know three well-preserved Viking ship finds in Norway, [all] excavated a long time ago,"" Knut Paasche, head of the Department of Digital Archaeology at NIKU and an expert on Viking ships, said in a statement.

DC mayor says Trump's Fourth of July celebration emptied security fund,"AP Domestic Nation's capital holds its Independence Day Parade The nation's capital held its Independence Day Parade along historic Constitution Avenue with the backdrop of the Washington D.C monuments. (July 4) WASHINGTON   District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser government says that the cost of President Donald Trump's Fourth of July celebration and the cost of addressing recent protests has emptied out a municipal fund used to provide security for public events and defend against terrorist threats. In a letter to Trump dated July 9, Bowser says the city spent about $1.7 million on Trump's ""July 4th holiday activities and subsequent first amendment demonstrations,"" as a result, the city's Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) will likely be empty before the end of the fiscal year. Bowser asked for the Trump administration's help in covering D.C.'s security costs, citing ""declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 Presidential Inauguration.""

Bush,"" Bowser added. ""As we continue to gather estimates for the next Inauguration, we ask for your help with ensuring the residents of the District of Columbia are not asked to cover millions of dollars of federal expenses and are able to maintain our high standards of protection for federal events,"" Bowser concluded. Trump's Fourth of July speech marked a departure from tradition as it included tank displays, plane flyovers, fireworks, and a speech from the president. Trump's critics had argued the speech threatened to politicize what had previously been a nonpartisan holiday tradition.

"Greenpeace activists scale 27,000-ton oil rig bound for North Sea","Environmental activists have climbed on board a 27,000-ton BP oil rig being towed off the coast of Scotland, and are vowing to stay put until the company halts plans to drill new wells. The two Greenpeace protesters have now ""set up camp"" on the rig, the group said in a statement Monday. The demonstrators scaled the structure on Sunday evening as it was leaving the inlet of Cromarty Firth in Northern Scotland, bound for the North Sea. Demonstrators in boats also drew up alongside the rig before climbing on board and unfurling a banner reading ""Climate Emergency."" They are demanding BP immediately stop drilling new wells and switch to renewable energy. The group said they have ""provisions to stay in place (on the rig) for days."" The rig was headed for the Vorlich oil field, where activists say BP plans to drill 30 million barrels of oil. ""Warm words flow from BP on their commitment to tackling climate change,"" said Jo, a Greenpeace activist from Scotland currently on board the rig. Jo's last name was not included in the statement. In reality, the rig was ""a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world,"" Jo said. ""We can't let that happen -- that's why we're here today."" BP responded in a statement , saying that, ""while we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk."" The company added that it shared the protesters' concerns about the environment and supported the Paris Climate Change Agreement. BP said it was working with the rig's owner and operator -- Transocean -- and the authorities to resolve the situation ""peacefully and safely."" A Transocean spokeswoman told CNN the company is working with BP on the matter and declined to comment further. The demonstration comes a month after Greenpeace activists locked themselves inside five massive containers, blocking the entrances to BP's London headquarters.",environmental issues,CNN,left
PA's public library lovers are rejoicing over additional funding,"Speaking to Pennsylvania librarians during a conference in Harrisburg in October, State Rep. Stan Saylor (R., York) promised to do everything he could to increase public library funding and restore funding to $75 million, where it stood prior to being slashed a decade ago. So, when Gov. Tom Wolf signed the state's new $34 billion budget on June 28, and it included an additional $5 million for the state's public libraries, supporters rejoiced. Saylor had done it, many advocates felt. It was the first time since around 2006 the state's public libraries would see a significant boost in operational funding. Read more: Gov. Wolf signs budget containing some items Democrats oppose While, it's too soon to tell how much each of the state's 470 libraries will receive, news of additional funding comes on the heels of City Council's approving an additional $3.5 million for the Free Library of Philadelphia in June. The move followed protests and complaints that a lack of funding had caused frequent library closures, shorter hours and long waits for books and materials. The Free library's annual budget is $52 million, with the rest coming from the state and private donors. Last fall, the Pennsylvania Libraries Association, headed by Christi Buker, hosted the Harrisburg conference where Saylor spoke. At the time, Saylor, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee and is a longtime library supporter, discussed the importance of libraries and their role in education and in communities. Buker and Saylor spoke with The Inquirer this week about what the additional funding will mean for libraries. We asked Buker … How much was the increase for Pennsylvania's public libraries? The public library subsidy was increased by $5 million. So, we went from [a budget allocation of] $54.47 million to $59.47 million. What is the Public Library subsidy? That is state aid to (public) libraries … in Pennsylvania. How will this funding increase help public libraries? It's going to help pay for staff, it's going to help pay for the electric bill, it's going to help pay for building maintenance, and all the other aspects, including internet, computer and technology that libraries need to … help all citizens regardless of their wealth. Why does this funding increase matter? Libraries have been faced with increasing expenses and they really haven't had any more money to pay for them … This increase will help them cover current expenses, and help them work towards restoring their operations. It's not really enough for them to do major new things. This is just really to help cover the increasing costs that we've been dealing with without additional funds for so long. We asked Saylor … You seem so passionate about libraries. Why are they a priority? I've seen the impact that libraries have had on people's lives, from seniors, to young children. In my own district, I have people who have internet access and people who don't … So a lot of people, as well as in my district, are able to go in and do their resumes, and work from there. … And young people can go in and do research. Why does this funding increase matter? This provides low-income families, seniors who are on a fixed income, opportunities to be able to do things that normally they wouldn't be able to. … And in the city of Philadelphia, for instance, libraries are so critical because poverty is high. So this gives those families who are in poverty and low income opportunities to get the resources for their children, that otherwise they wouldn't have. Anything else? I would ask local governments … officials, to please remember, the funding from the state is based upon matching funds from those municipalities. And I would encourage those municipalities not to devalue libraries. They should continue to fund and actually increase funding to the local libraries, because it's so critical.     ©2019 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,The Philadelphia Inquirer,left
1st redo in 35 years for New Orleans' 60-year-old Storyland,"NEW ORLEANS (AP)   The 60-year-old Storyland playground in New Orleans' City Park is getting its first makeover in 35 years, with four new exhibits and updates to the 18 already there. The playground's accordion-playing alligator is moving away from Peter Pan's Pirate Ship, where he's stood for decades, and will be surrounded by flower-shaped drums and color-coded xylophones for kids to play. Humpty Dumpty, who holds a flag urging, ""Build Your Imagination,"" will sit above a playhouse where kids can build walls with giant Legos or act out whatever stories they want. Kids will be able to climb Jack's beanstalk to a tunnel and slide. And a layabout hare will lounge near a tortoise shell big enough for even grown-ups to crawl under and play the slow and steady race-winner, said Casie Duplechain, director of development at City Park. About 263,000 people visited last year, Duplechain said. She said the $800,000 project will close the playground for several months, beginning Monday. The reopening date hasn't been set but will be in the fall, she said. Admission will rise from $4 to $5 per person. Makeovers for the current attractions will add interactive play and even a bit of science. ""As it stands, kids can go in and climb, but the parents just watch,"" Duplechain said. Now, she said, ""Each one will be an opportunity for parents to play with their children."" For instance, Hey Diddle Diddle has an above-ground spaceship so kids can play that they're joining the cow on her translunar trip. The spaceship will be brought to Earth so kids who use wheelchairs can go in, too. New buttons will start it vibrating, as if it's about to take off. Exhibits inside will show NASA's gender and racial diversity, Duplechain said. Outside, one large panel will show the solar system, with planets that children can spin. A second panel will show a NASA satellite photograph of the Earth. Another addition will be a space suit ""photo op"" cutout with the helmet open for kids' faces. The Gingerbread Man will stand by a new Candyland game, with an arrow to spin and a path of color-coded blocks. Each color has a different question about other stories and rhymes, such as ""The cow takes a giant leap in space. What does she jump over?"" ""The kids are so excited. So are their parents,"" Duplechain said.",environmental issues,AP,center
summer school starts at huntington beach's edison high after toxic dump prompted air tests,"Responding to concerns that health issues at Edison High School may be related to the nearby toxic landfill, Principal Jennifer Graves notified parents Sunday that air monitoring showed the Huntington Beach campus's air at ""a healthy level"" and that summer school and athletic activities would proceed as planned. Summer school begins Tuesday. Cleanup of the now-shuttered Ascon oil-waste landfill was halted indefinitely June 6 after neighbors expressed outrage at a community meeting over the dust and toxic fumes stirred up by an ongoing cleanup of the site. More worries were expressed during a June 11 school board meeting, after which Superintendent Clint Harwick said that he would immediately pursue air-quality monitoring on campus, which is kitty corner from the 38-acre dump site. He also said closure of summer activities at the school would be considered if circumstances merited it. But the tests subsequently performed showed that such steps weren't necessary, according to emails and automated calls sent out by Graves. ""We have conducted independent 3rd party testing and have received results that air quality on campus is at a healthy level,"" Graves wrote in her email. ""We will continue to work with the city, state legislature, Air Quality Management District and Department of Toxic Substances Control to ensure student and staff safety."" The Department of Toxic Substances Control has reported just three minor instances of excessive dust or toxins from 648 tests at the perimeter of the site this year. But neighbors have reported ongoing respiratory issues, headaches, rashes, nausea and other maladies they've linked to the work that began in February. Parents say students at the school have experienced similar problems. Work was initially shut down on June 6 because of chemical odors reported   and verified by air-quality officials   at the school. That work stoppage was subsequently extended indefinitely by the toxic substances agency while higher dust-blocking fences are erected on the site and other dust-control measures are explored. On the Facebook page Huntington Beach Landfill Awareness Project , a forum predominantly featuring neighbors upset with the landfill project, posters expressed ongoing frustration following Graves' announcement, including the lack of details about the monitoring and future plans at the school. ""I don't believe for one second that the air quality is 'healthy' as she is declaring,"" Michelle Clair Perelman wrote in response to a Southern California News Group inquiry on the page. Related links Huntington Beach landfill outrage spurs school officials to address health concerns Community outrage halts landfill project near Edison High School in Huntington Beach Your recyclables are going to the dump and here's why Huntington Beach desalination plant: How it might have been operating by now Perelman has a son who will be a senior at Edison and plans to play summer league baseball at the school despite her concerns for his health. ""My son is worried about getting kicked off the (school's varsity) team if he doesn't show up,"" she said. This is the final stage of cleanup at the landfill, which closed in 1984. Toxic substances agency's Cypress branch chief, Javier Hinojosa, has said the site will be capped and remain undeveloped as private green space.

"Volcano erupts on Italian island of Stromboli, kills one person","ROME, July 3 (Reuters) - A volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli erupted on Wednesday, releasing hot trapped magma in a powerful explosion, killing one person and enveloping the popular tourist destination in ash, witnesses and local officials said. The person, believed to be a tourist, was killed by falling stones during a walk, a rescue service official said. A second person was injured. The unexpected eruption started fires on the western side of the small Mediterranean island, which lies north of Sicily, off the toe of Italy. Fire crews were being called in from nearby locations and a Canadair plane was already in action. ""We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar,"" said Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Fico Grande, on the east side of the island. ""We plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud,"" she told Reuters. Fiona Carter, a British tourist on the island of Panarea, some 27 km (17 miles) from Stromboli, heard the blast. ""We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,"" she told Reuters. ""The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely. Several boats set off for Stromboli,"" she added. Stefano Branca, an expert with the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV), said there had been a ""paroxysmal eruption"" on the island, when high-pressure magma explodes from a shallow, underground reservoir. ""These are events of great intensity and quite rare,"" he told Reuters. Tourists often climb to the 924-metre (3,000-foot) summit of the volcano and peer into its crater, with small puffs of molten rock regularly blasted into the sky. It was not clear if anyone was on the crater at the time of the blast. According to the geology.com website, Stromboli is one of the most active volcanoes on the planet and has been erupting almost continuously since 1932. The island was the setting for a 1950 movie starring Ingrid Bergman and, with other islands in the Aeolian archipelago, has become a favourite location in recent decades for holiday homes for the rich and famous.

Aptos camp counselor sentenced to 30 years in prison for producing child porn,"A camp counselor from Santa Cruz County was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday for producing and conspiring to distribute and receive child pornography. Ryan Michael Spencer, 21, filled a hard drive with more than 30,000 images and videos of child pornography, officials said. On his iPhone, he stored hundreds of images taken of children under his supervision as they undressed in camp cabins, pool locker rooms and other locations, according to the Northern District Court of California in San Francisco. Some of the children were as young as four years old. United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer handed down the sentence roughly nine months after Spencer pleaded guilty to producing child porn of more than a dozen children he was responsible to care for during his employment as a camp counselor and babysitter in the Santa Cruz area. One video saved onto Spencer's iPhone shows him molesting a child he was babysitting, officials said. Investigators believe he molested at least two children he babysat ""on several occasions,"" raping one boy who was younger than 10 years old. Officials did not release the name of the camp that employed him, or say whether he was employed as a state-licensed child care provider. Detectives with the FBI initially starting investigating Spencer more than two years ago, when a witness told police officers that Spencer's co-defendant, Bryan Petersen, a chess coach and tutor in the Tiburon area, had child porn on his computer and Dropbox account. FBI detectives served a search warrant at Petersen's Tiburon residence and determined he had received ""thousands"" of images and videos from Spencer dating back to March 2015   including the hard drive with more than 30,000 images. The two men had repeatedly traded child pornography on the Kik Messenger mobile application from March 2015 until Spencer's arrest in April 2017, officials said. When FBI detectives scoured Spencer's home in 2017, they found three electronic devices that were password-protected or encrypted, making them impossible to access without Spencer's cooperation, officials said. The court fined Spencer $1,000 every day that he refused to decrypt the devices for investigators. After 22 days of refusing a magistrate judge's order   and racking up a $22,000 fine after being held in civil contempt by the court   he provided the passwords. In addition to Spencer's 30-year prison term, Breyer ordered him to be under a 15-year term of supervised release and required him to pay restitution to the victims. The amount of restitution has yet to be determined, officials said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie D. Garcia prosecuted the case. Peterson, who has pleaded guilty to the same charges as Spencer, with the exception of the contempt of court charge, is scheduled to be sentenced on August 21.

Bill Gates says letting Android win mobile was his 'biggest mistake' at Microsoft,"Recently former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates said his biggest mistake was whatever led to the Microsoft being behind what became the biggest non-Apple phone operating system. In 2017 a Microsoft executive made it clear that it would no longer actively develop its Windows 10 Mobile operating system. That year, Google's Android was the clear leader in terms of smartphone shipments, with nearly 86% share, according to Gartner. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says letting Google's Android platform become dominant was his ""biggest mistake"" at the company. The Windows desktop operating system has been a core piece of Microsoft through much of its 44-year history, but Microsoft has failed to win a leadership position in mobile operating systems. It lags behind Alphabet's Google, and Apple. At today's Microsoft, Windows remains a contributor of revenue and profit, but Microsoft has moved on to focus more on cloud infrastructure and applications, essentially ceding the mobile platform business. Gates made the comments to David Rubinstein on Monday, speaking at a Economic Club of Washington luncheon: ""We're in the field of doing operating systems for personal computers. We knew the mobile phone would be very popular, and so we were doing what was called Windows Mobile. We missed being the dominant mobile operating system by a very tiny amount. We were distracted during our antitrust trial. We didn't assign the best people to do the work. So it's the biggest mistake I made in terms of something that was clearly within our skill set. We were clearly the company that should have achieved that, and we didn't. We allowed this Motorola design win, and therefore the software momentum to go to Android, and so it became the dominant non-Apple mobile phone operating system globally."" At the time mobile computing was taking off, Microsoft's CEO was Steve Ballmer, not Gates. But Gates was still in some initiatives at Microsoft, holding the title of Chief Software Architect from 2001 through 2008 and Chairman of the Board until 2014. Gates' comments invoking the antitrust case from the U.S. Justice Department also come after reports about how federal regulators could be changing their approaches to looking at major technology companies, including Google . Earlier in the year Sen. Elizabeth Warren pointed to the Microsoft case as part of an argument that the government should seek to break up major technology companies.

Prosecutors: Illinois man carried out plan to kill Chinese grad student,"PEORIA, Ill., June 24 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Monday accused an Illinois man of carrying out a calculated plan to kidnap and kill a Chinese graduate student two years ago, in closing arguments of the man's murder trial in central Illinois. Brendt Christensen, 29, could face the death penalty if he is convicted in the June 2017 abduction and murder of Yingying Zhang, a 26-year-old student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her body has not been found, but prosecutors said an evidence team matched her DNA to blood found in three places in Christensen's bedroom. While the state of Illinois has outlawed capital punishment, a federal trial allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty. ""He raped her, he murdered her and then spent the next three weeks trying to cover up the crime,"" said Eugene Miller, an assistant U.S. attorney for central Illinois. Miller said Christensen had carefully planned to murder someone and had chosen Zhang because she was small and appeared to be an easy target. During the defense's closing arguments earlier on Monday, Christensen's lawyers acknowledged that their client killed Zhang but hinted they hoped to persuade the jury to spare Christensen's life during the penalty phase of the trial. ""This is not the ultimate decision. You have to realize there's more,"" attorney Elisabeth Pollock said to the jury. The judge warned Pollock twice not to refer to the possible penalty following the verdict, as the jury was only supposed to consider the evidence. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors said Christensen was obsessed with serial killers including Ted Bundy, who murdered dozens of women in the 1970s. They alleged that Christensen took Zhang to his apartment where she fought for her life as Christensen hit her over the head with a baseball bat, raped her and stabbed her in the neck before cutting off her head. The jury began deliberating on Monday, immediately after hearing closing arguments from both sides. Investigators were led to Christensen after surveillance cameras in Urbana, 130 miles (210 km) south of Chicago, recorded Zhang getting into a black car that authorities later traced to him, according to an arrest warrant affidavit by an FBI agent.

82 migrants missing at sea day after deadly libya airstrike,"CAIRO (AP)   A boat carrying 86 migrants from Libya sank in the Mediterranean Sea and only three passengers are known to have survived the shipwreck the day after an airstrike on a Libyan detention center killed at least 44 migrants, the U.N. migration agency said Thursday. The International Organization for Migration said the boat sank late Wednesday off the Tunisian city of Zarzis and 82 of the migrants who had been on board were missing. Fishermen pulled four men from the sinking boat, and one died overnight, Lorena Lando, the agency's head in Tunisia, said. The United Nations and aid groups have blamed the airstrike tragedy in part on the European Union's policy of partnering with Libyan militias to prevent migrants from trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe. Critics of the EU's program say it leaves migrants at the mercy of brutal traffickers or confined in detention facilities near front lines, often without adequate food and water. Migrants who survived late Tuesday's airstrike said they were conscripted by a local militia to work in a weapons workshop. The decision to store weapons at the facility in Tajoura, to the east of Tripoli, may have made it a target for the self-styled Libyan National Army, which is at war with an array of militias allied with a weak, U.N.-recognized government in the capital. The Tripoli government has blamed the strike, which wounded more than 130, on the LNA and its foreign backers. The LNA, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, says it targeted a nearby militia position but denies striking the hangar where the migrants were being held. Hifter, whose forces control much of eastern and southern Libya, has received aid from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Around 6,000 migrants, most from elsewhere in Africa, are being held in Libya's detention centers after being intercepted by the EU-funded coast guard. In Tajoura, hundreds of migrants are held in several hangars next to what appears to be a weapon cache. Two migrants told The Associated Press that for months they were sent day and night to the workshop inside the detention center. ""We clean the anti-aircraft guns. I saw a large amount of rockets and missiles too,"" said a young migrant who has been held at Tajoura for nearly two years. Another migrant recounted a nearly two-year odyssey in which he fled war in his native country and was passed from one trafficker to another until he reached the Libyan coast. He boarded a boat that was intercepted by the coast guard, which later transferred him to Tajoura, where he was wounded in Wednesday's airstrike. ""I fled from the war to come to this hell of Libya,"" he said. ""My days are dark."" The migrants requested that their names and nationalities not be published, fearing reprisal. Many of those who died in the attack were crushed under debris as they slept. Pictures shared by the migrants show the hangar reduced to a pile of rubble littered with body parts. More than 48 hours after the strike, relief workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble while the wounded lay on bloody mattresses in a courtyard, receiving medical aid. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid said Thursday that it received reports of guards firing on the migrants as they tried to flee after the airstrikes. A migrant told the AP it was not clear if the guards fired at the migrants or in the air. Despite the international outrage following the airstrike, aid groups said there are no plans to evacuate the migrants and that nowhere in Tripoli is safe. ""We are not aware of plans to relocate the migrants that remain in Tajoura,"" said Safa Mshli, an International Organization for Migration spokeswoman. ""Migrants intercepted or rescued at sea should not be returned to Libya, where they will face the same inhumane conditions."" ___ Associated Press writers Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",crime,Los Angeles Times,left
Panic at DC pride parade sends people running,"Video by The Washington Post WASHINGTON   A panic caused by a mistaken belief that a gun had been fired during a pride parade in the nation's capital sent people running through the city's streets, authorities said. Police said some who fled had minor injuries and seven were taken to hospitals. ""As the officers were going to the scene, there was a crowd of people going away from it and some of the individuals in the crowd said there was a man with a gun and that someone had fired a shot,"" said Guillermo Rivera, a commander with the Metropolitan Police Department. The man was taken into custody and is facing a gun possession charge, Rivera said. City officials said no shots were fired Saturday evening. ""There is NO Active Shooter at Dupont Circle. There are injuries from people running from what they thought were gunshots. But there is NO ACTIVE SHOOTER at Dupont Circle,"" Kevin Donahue, the deputy mayor for public safety, said in a tweet posted shortly after the incident. Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted that she had been briefed by police and there were ""no shots fired."" She said fire department personnel were ""on the scene to treat minor injuries / due to reports of a shooting."" Elizabeth Hernandez, 19, was among the thousands celebrating LGBTQ pride in the city when she said she heard ""pop, pop"" and suddenly barricades were being tossed over and a crowd of people starting running frantically from the area. ""Everything fell and everyone said 'run!,'"" said Hernandez, of Falls Church, Virginia. She ran down the block and was pushed into a restaurant, where she went into a bathroom with a group of fellow revelers. Ashley Smith, the president of Capital Pride Alliance, which puts on the event, said he saw people running toward him from Dupont Circle. ""We cannot allow this incident, until we know all the facts of it, we cannot allow this incident to ruin the pride celebration going on this weekend,"" Smith said. ""We're very focused on wanting to make sure we continue to have a great event for the rest of the weekend."" He said the group spends extensive time planning security procedures. Rivera said police felt they had an ""adequate amount of resources on the ground, which is why we were able to respond so quickly.""",crime,The Washington Post,left
"'Because all of our neighbors matter': Respond Now marks 50 years, helps for 14,000 families","In 1969, a lone employee paid by Catholic Charities led dozens of volunteers determining the need   primarily food-related   in six suburban communities and how to meet it at a time when the term ""safety net"" was associated with circus trapeze artists. The result was an effort called Respond Now, and 50 years later, the Chicago-Heights-based non-profit is staffed by 11 employees and powered by volunteers who contribute more than 6,000 hours every year, serving nearly 25 communities. In human terms, that service translates into 14,000 families who've come to Respond Now with housing, hunger and health issues. The agency serves a geographic area roughly bordered by interstates 80 and 57 on the north and west, the Indiana state line on the east and the Will-Kankakee county border on the south. Executive Director Carl Wolf said the volume of clients ""is a sign our services have an impact."" Families pick up a week's worth of groceries once a month at Respond Now's food pantry. Some clients get money for prescription medicine. The agency also helps about 100 families a year when a financial crisis hits to stay in their homes through one-time payments for mortgage, rent or utilities. ""They have to show they can pay their bills normally,"" Wolf said. In addition, the agency provides rapid re-housing yearly for 30 homeless people. Everyone needs the basics. Wolf said. ""If we want our communities to be successful, it's important to have the basics in place."" Expansions in the past six years funded by area businesses, churches and individuals as well as grants have left the organization ""well positioned to do more,"" he said. Respond Now's services, Wolf said, provide ""extra stability"" to the South Suburbs which, he said, have a higher rate of poverty than the rest of Chicagoland. He attributed the poverty to area economic changes brought on by ""disinvestment   the abandonment by industry,"" the area's ""isolation from the larger Chicagoland and migration of people from the (Chicago) housing projects."" Wolf declined to speculate on ""the larger questions regarding economic development"" and south suburban Chicago, but acknowledged seeing ""some stabilization from the 2008 crisis. ""Yeah, there's improvement ,"" he said. ""There are jobs in the University Park/I-57 corridor. The Halsted Corridor is doing good; there's a little bit here and there."" Wolf said Respond Now's expanded services include financial education and ""could provide more in terms of financial literacy, but we've come to a crossroads in our ability to provide an increased level of services."" ""We're hamstrung in terms of space,"" he said noting the current location in the 1400 block of Emerald Avenue is good, ""but it's not sufficient."" So Respond Now will mark its 50th anniversary Sept. 19 with a Sept. 19 fundraiser at Flossmoor Station, 1035 Sterling Ave., Flossmoor. Event highlights include live music, craft beers and raffle tickets that include a prize option to be ""brewmaster for a day"" at Flossmoor Station. The restaurant and brewery is noted for producing more than 80 award-winning craft beers over the past 25 years. Additionally, Flossmoor Station will sell a signature beer during September for Respond Now, with a portion of the sale price going to the social service agency. Respond Now board President Patrick Gallagher, noting the organization was started by the community, said continued support ""gives us the flexibility to do the work the community entrusted to us 50 years ago, because all of our neighbors matter.""     ©2019 Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",health,Chicago Tribune,center

Cop killer and two-time death row inmate dies in his cell at San Quentin,"A man who was twice sentenced to death for killing a Garden Grove police officer nearly 40 years ago died at San Quentin State Prison on Sunday, authorities said. John George Brown, 71, was found unconscious in his cell shortly after 6:15 p.m., according to a news release from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Prison staff tried to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead about 6:45 p.m., officials said. Brown was convicted of shooting and killing Officer Donald Reed, 27, in a Garden Grove bar on June 7, 1980, as Reed and three other officers tried to arrest Brown on drug and assault warrants. The shooting, which news accounts described as one of the bloodiest in Orange County history , wounded four other people   two officers and two bar patrons. A jury found Brown guilty of first-degree murder and related offenses, and he was sentenced to death in 1982. More than a decade later, in 1998, the California Supreme Court ordered that Brown's conviction be downgraded to second-degree murder or that he be given a new trial because evidence had not been forwarded to his defense team during the original trial. At issue was a preliminary blood test performed by the Orange County Sheriff's Department that showed Brown may have taken PCP the night of the shooting. A more thorough test did not detect any drugs, authorities said. Brown's defense attorneys were told of the final test, but not of the first one . Attorneys who appealed his conviction argued that the first test could help sway jurors into believing that the murder was not premeditated. The Orange County district attorney's office elected to retry the case. In 2000, a jury again convicted Brown of first-degree murder and sent him back to death row . More than 850 people have been sentenced to death in California since 1978, when the state reinstated capital punishment. Since then, 80 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, 26 have committed suicide, 12 have died from other causes and six   including Brown   are pending a cause of death, according to figures provided by corrections officials. Only 13 inmates have been executed . In March, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a moratorium on the death penalty , granting temporary reprieves to all of the state's condemned inmates. With 734 inmates , California's death row is the nation's largest. alex.wigglesworth@latimes.com Twitter: @phila_lex",crime,Los Angeles Times,left
Amtrak restores service after coal train derails in Great Dismal Swamp; environmental concerns remain,"Amtrak service to and from Norfolk is restored Thursday, days after a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed while traveling through the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. The derailment occurred Tuesday morning, less than a mile east of the Chesapeake/Suffolk line. The train had been transporting coal when 36 cars went off the track. Amtrak service was suspended as the wreckage continues to be cleaned up. Modified Amtrak service includes: Northeast Regional 94 will operate from Richmond, Va., to Boston. Northeast Regional 95 will operate from Boston to Washington, D.C. Northeast Regional 93 will operate from Boston to Richmond, Va. Northeast Regional 84 will operate from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Customers can contact Amtrak at 1-800-872-7245 for assistance modifying reservations. Northeast Corridor service between Boston and Washington, D.C., will continue to operate as scheduled. Meanwhile, there are concerns the spilled coal could impact wildlife in the wildlife refuge, including endangered species. The coal that was being transported is a fine material, almost like sand. Refuge manager Chris Lowie said there is a moderate concern that heavy metals in the coal might ultimately cause pollution of the water, but they will not know the extent until they start sampling it after the wreck is cleaned up. A Norfolk Southern spokesperson said no injuries were reported during the incident, and the coal spill is confined to a relatively small area adjacent to Norfolk Souther's tracks. She added there is no impact on any major waterway. Norfolk Southern operations and environmental personnel are on-site working closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to coordinate cleanup efforts and develop an environmental restoration plan. The Great Dismal Swamp is home to endangered species such as long-eared bats and red-cockaded woodpeckers. But the coal will most likely impact aquatic species such as snakes and turtles.

Protesters Want All Philadelphia Police Officers Connected To Alleged Racist Social Media Posts To Be Removed From Streets,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS)   Philadelphia Police officials announced Wednesday that more than 70 officers are now off the street in connection to controversial Facebook posts. Members of the Rally for Justice coalition say more needs to be done and want all the officers connected to be taken off the street. The Rally for Justice coalition held a protest on Thursday that began at City Hall, calling for more action to be taken in the scandal connected to a number of police officers. The group is comprised of civic leaders NAACP members the black clergy and other activists. 72 Philadelphia Police Officers On Administrative Duty Over Alleged Racist And Violent Social Media Posts, Commissioner Says They are not fully happy with the response to hundreds of officers who reportedly posted racist and violent public Facebook posts unearthed by the Plain View Project. ""We support Derrick Green's resolution, calling for hearings on the racist police who posted on Facebook,"" Solomon Jones said, ""and said openly that they hate the people whose communities they patrol."" The group wants city council to intervene on the heels of Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross's announcement that 72 of the 328 officers involved have been placed on administrative duty. The Rally for Justice coalition showed up in force at the City Council meeting Thursday afternoon. They say they won't be satisfied until all officers involved in this scandal are removed from the streets. ""We know there's several members of council are planning to make statements around this issue, we need them to make a statement and speak up and do what they're hired to do, their job is to represent the people,"" Jones said. 'Get Them Off The Streets': Protesters Demand Hundreds Of Philadelphia Police Officers Accused Of Racist Facebook Posts Be Placed On Desk Duty ""So today, we want our city leaders, who we just voted for to join with us to make certain that the police that do not want to police our community are removed,"" Paula Peebles said. Despite calls for mass firings within the police department, Fraternal Order of Police officials say their officials deserve due process as the investigation plays out. ""We feel that it's excessive to take over 6,000 police officers off the street with the level of violence that's occurring in the city,"" FOP vice president John McGrody said. ""We're also backing the officers here on a daily basis with the interviews. We think the investigation is far too broad.""

"His community needed a new road, so this farmer built one by himself","KAGANDA, Kenya -- Nicholas Muchemi took the ax, pick and hoe he used every day on his coffee and tea farm and started digging into the reddish-brown dirt on a hill next to his house. He had one goal in mind: to create a road he and his neighbors could use to make it easier to get in and out of town. He spent a few long weeks working on his farm in the morning hours, then building his road in the evening. What Muchemi had to show for his hard work was a dirt road about a quarter of a mile up a steep hill in Kaganda village, Kenya. ""The hardest part to make was places where the drainage had to pass and there were deep roots getting in the way,"" Muchemi said. Neighbors in this small, rural farming community watched as the 44-year-old continued digging into the earth day after day. By the time he finished, they knew he'd created something valuable for everyone who lives nearby. Children now use the road Muchemi built to get to school. Mothers use it to get to the market faster than the roundabout road that existed before. Other neighbors use the dirt road to get to the town's church, which is at the top of the steep hill. News of Muchemi's feat spread quickly after his neighbor posted about it on Facebook . Members of the local government took notice. They installed a new roof on Muchemi's house and gave the farmer a cow as a way to repay him for his kindness. They've also promised to gravel and maintain Muchemi's road. Muchemi never expected anything in return for helping his community, but he's thrilled that his good deed has inspired so many people. ""I feel overjoyed that I did work that makes everyone happy,"" Muchemi said. ""Even the whole country is happy and that makes me feel joy."" He says one day, he'll wake up inspired and continue developing his road further into town.

Gavin Newsom agrees to sign California bill restricting vaccine exemptions,"A proposed law that would restrict medical exemptions for vaccines has support from California Gov. Gavin Newsom's now that it was modified to address his concerns about parents' rights. Newsom told a gaggle of reporters on Tuesday during an event with Native American tribes that he would sign the newly amended Senate Bill 276, which was changed after passing the Senate to address concerns that the state would have too much power over medical exemptions issued by doctors. In early June he expressed doubts about the bill , saying he didn't want government officials making decisions that should be between patients and doctors. State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, had been working with the governor's office for two weeks before he announced that he accepted changes that both Newsom and the Medical Board of California wanted to see. Pan expanded a major provision of the bill that would have restricted doctors to guidelines under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when they administer medical exemptions. The guidelines now include more exemptions that are allowed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""We worked very closely,"" Newsom said. ""The amendments reflect not only my concerns but also a number of key representatives whose job it is to carry out the law. This will make it workable and addressed some of my bureaucratic anxieties."" Parents are given additional power under the amendments, because they can appeal decisions made by public health officials who might revoke or deny medical exemptions. ""I want to thank Gov. Newsom for his leadership on children's health and standing up for science and the importance of vaccination by supporting SB 276,"" Pan said in a Tuesday statement regarding the amendments. ""I appreciate that the governor has worked with me in crafting a California solution to halting the abuse of medical exemptions that endanger our children."" The Assembly must pass the bill before Newsom can sign it. Pan argues that children who need medical exemptions will be able to get them under the legislation, but that signing off on exemptions should be a rare occurrence. He's also argued that the national measles outbreak ?  with 52 out of 1044 cases reported in California ?  could worsen and spread to children who are too sick to get vaccinated, by way of children going to school under fraudulent exemptions. But the Advocates for Physicians' Rights still opposes the bill, and issued a statement saying that the oversight would compel doctors to ""quit their job."" ""My greatest concern is this bill not only violates the medical freedom of an individual, but also violates the physician's right to treat their patients,"" said Nicole Shorrock, a doctor who testified against the bill during a committee hearing. ""Vaccines are like all medications and have inherent risks.""     ©2019 The Sacramento Bee (Sacramento, Calif.)

Two mysterious objects were seen floating above Kansas City. They (probably) weren't aliens,"For a few hours on Thursday evening, people in Kansas City thought they had a bona fide ""X-Files"" case on their hands. High in the sky above the city, two small white spheres seemed to just be floating above the clouds. What the heck were they? Folks in the Midwestern city didn't call up the special FBI agents from the fictional 90s TV show for answers about these UFOs. They went to the media. CNN affiliate KMBC reported numerous calls from viewers seeking an explanation. Joe Lauria, a meteorologist at WDAF , another CNN affiliate, said the strange objects could be part of Project Loon. That's the Google project that seeks to bring the internet to rural and remote areas by launching huge balloons into the air and beaming down a signal. But the station later reported that ""a meteorologist who works for Project Loon"" nixed that theory. The National Weather Service in Kansas City also weighed in. ""We honestly have no explanation for the floating objects over Kansas City,"" the weather service said in a tweet . Well, that's not particularly helpful. But at least the weather service included a photo of the sky and the two mysterious orbs with the tweet. KMBC later reported that the mystery orbs may be part of a flight test for the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, on Monday night. The feds wonder, too People just weren't talking about UFOs in the Midwest. They discussed them in the nation's capital, too. And not just anybody. We're talking military officials and lawmakers. Officials from the Navy met with some US senators, including the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, during a classified briefing Wednesday about a series of reported encounters by the US Navy with unidentified aircraft . Several pilots told The New York Times about multiple encounters with UFOs with no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes. And back in April, the Navy introduced guidelines for its pilots to report unexplainable events so the military can keep track of what may, or may not, be happening.

Lawyer: Flynn will keep cooperating after co-conspirator revelations,"Michael Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell said Thursday that her client doesn't plan on ending his cooperation with the government, as federal prosecutors say they intend to argue he was a co-conspirator in charges filed against Flynn's former business partner. Powell told The Hill that Flynn is ""continuing to cooperate."" ""We're doing everything we possibly can,"" she added. When asked if that could change in the future, Powell replied, ""I don't think so."" Flynn's case was roiled earlier this week when unsealed court documents showed that federal prosecutors plan to argue that the former national security adviser is a co-conspirator in the case against his former business associate Bijan Kian. Government attorneys had previously stated that they wanted to call Flynn as a witness in Kian's trial, scheduled for next week. But they suggested in one of the court filings that they may no longer be fully confident in Flynn's testimony, and will seek to submit statements he made to investigations as evidence in the trial rather than putting Flynn on the stand. The court document pointed to a July 2 email from federal prosecutors that says they ""do not necessarily agree"" with Flynn's characterizations on how he made a Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing that included false information about ties between his company's lobbying and the Turkish government. The email states that Flynn's new attorneys maintain that their client didn't give his previous lawyers false information, didn't knowing the FARA filing had false information and that he didn't read the document. Kian was charged in federal court in Virginia last year, alongside Turkish national Kamil Ekim Alptekin, with acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey in relation to the now-shuttered Flynn Intel Group's lobbying campaign against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Flynn is also set to be sentenced in D.C., after he pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The former Trump official agreed to cooperate with former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe as part of the deal. Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is overseeing the D.C. case, ordered the parties in the case to make filings on how they expect the developments in Kian's case to impact Flynn's sentencing. Government attorneys said in a filing on Wednesday that they don't know at this point whether the case would impact the sentencing, and that they would ""reassess"" after Kian's trial. Powell also told reporters on Thursday that she didn't know whether the latest developments would impact the government's prior recommendation that Flynn face little to no prison time. ""That's purely up to the Department of Justice and what stance they want to take,"" Powell said. ""Our position is that he is continuing to cooperate. We have done everything humanly possible to do so. And we're going to continue to do that."" Powell is also set to make a filing in D.C. later Thursday afternoon responding to the court documents unsealed in Kian's case. She declined to provide details, but characterized the upcoming filing as being ""another little truth bomb."" Powell recently joined Flynn's legal team after he unexpectedly fired his attorneys last month. She was on Capitol Hill on Thursday to deliver a lecture titled ""What it Really Means to be a Federal Prosecutor."" The event was sponsored by The Fund for American Studies (TFAS) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who attended the talk.",legal arguments,The Hill,center
Paper or plastic? It's complicated ...,"Paper or plastic? It's a question that has haunted shoppers nearly as long as that Shakespearian inquiry ""To be or not to be?"" (OK, not really). So what's an environmentally-conscious shopper to do? Welllllll... it's actually a bit complicated. Here are a few facts to figure in, according to the New York times. Americans use more than 100 billion polyethylene plastic bags every year. Only a small portion are ever recycled because they clog up the machinery at most recycling centers. They end up in a 'landfill'-- where they can take 'centuries' to decompose. A plastic bag doesn't do too much harm sitting in a landfill. It's when they escape that the trouble starts. When people don't dispose of their bags the right way they end up threatening wildlife and clogging our waterways. So just ask for paper, right? Guess what... there are problems there too.Paper bags degrade more easily and they're a renewable resource, but it actually takes more energy to make that paper bag from pulp than it does to make a plastic bag-- from oil. So maybe a reusable bag is the way to go... but that's only if you actually 'reuse' it... a LOT. Britain's Environment Agency found you'd have to use those cotton bags or more durable plastic ones 131 times-- yep, 131-- before that bag's global warming impact was less than that of a plastic bag-- used only once. If all of this leaves your head spinning, hang on to this final thought: Experts say one-third of the food we produce in the world is wasted, and when that food waste ends up in landfills it produces a large amount of methane... a more powerful greenhouse gas than even carbon dioxide. That's not even taking into consideration all the wasted resources that went into growing and producing that food. Bottom line is this: If we REALLY want to be environmentally friendly, we may need to think harder about what we're putting inside those bags, and only buy and prepare what we're going to use.",environmental issues,New York Times,left
New agreement means more sheriff's deputies for Chester County schools,"CHESTER, SC More officers will be in Chester County schools after the district, county and sheriff's office reached an agreement Monday. Chester County School District leaders signed an agreement with the Chester County Sheriff's Office and the county to increase the number of school resource officers in the district, said Chester County Sheriff Max Dorsey. ""This provides a certified law enforcement officer for these campuses that will serve as a deterrent for criminal activity that may or may not could come from the outside,"" Dorsey said. ""It serves as a deterrent for criminal activity by people who are on campus. But most importantly, it allows for these officers to engage in the life and well-being of these students."" Certified officers from the sheriff's department will serve five schools -- Chester High School, Lewisville High School, Great Falls Middle and High School, Chester Middle, and Lewisville Middle. There were three school resource officers before the agreement, Dorsey said. ""This is an effort to improve our security footprint at these campuses,"" Dorsey said. ""This is a continuation of building upon there being certified police officers in these schools."" Private security officers will still be used to serve schools where needed, Dorsey said. ""Working hand in hand with the sheriff's office benefits our community, our children and the safety of those children,"" said Chester County School District Superintendent Angela Bain. ""We have a blended system and it's working really well."" Getting deputies into Chester County schools has been an ongoing struggle. In 2015, the district dropped deputies as resource officers in favor of private guards, The Herald previously reported. That decision was met with criticism from parents and then-sheriff Alex Underwood. In 2016, the district and county placed school resource officers in Chester County's three high schools, The Herald reported then. The new agreement adds sheriff's office deputies as resource officers at two middle schools, Dorsey said. Dorsey said one of his first goals after being sworn in as sheriff in May was to get officers in schools. Dorsey was named sheriff soon after Underwood was indicted by federal prosecutors. Underwood was suspended from office . ""I made this a priority from day one,"" Dorsey said. ""I couldn't do anything about the past, but I wanted to make sure I was doing all I could to bring the parties together where we could put some officers in the schools."" Under the agreement, effective until June 30, 2021, the county and the school district will each pay $127,338 a year to cover salaries and benefits for five officers. The agreement automatically renews on July 1, 2021, for one year. The sheriff's office will hire and supervise the school resource officers, according to the agreement. The officers' first point of contact is the school's principal. Dorsey said school resource officers in Chester County are expected to form relationships with the students. ""These are good officers and I have high expectations for them,"" he said.     ©2019 The Herald (Rock Hill, S.C.)

"Space Experts Visit JFK Library To Celebrate Moon Landing, Explore Future Missions","BOSTON (CBS)   Fifty years ago, men landed on the moon. It was the culmination of the vision of President John F. Kennedy to land on the moon by the end of the 1960's. On Wednesday, Boston's JFK Library and Museum commemorated that achievement while exploring the future of space travel. July 20, 1969 marks the day the world was transfixed by a grainy image coming all the way from the moon, as Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took those first historic steps, and Armstrong uttered the famous words ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" In a Space Summit hosted by Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, scientists, astronauts, and NASA experts came together at the library to consider what the words of President Kennedy mean for today. As Kennedy said in 1962, ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."" A panel of astronauts from the United States, Italy, Japan and Russia talked about where the space program has been and where it will go in the future. ""This is a big deal,"" Astronaut Tracy Caldwell said. ""The fact that we are here for the 50th anniversary and we're talking about going back to the moon is, I think, honoring President Kennedy and his vision."" Astronaut Chris Cassidy said, ""It's really about how it sets us up for what's next, going back to the moon and on to Mars. It's just super exciting for us."" The library also hosted a ""Space Expo"" designed for the next generation of space lovers. ""I think we should continue exploring space because there's still more to see,"" a young girl at the expo said. A young boy at the event said he wants to be the first person to step foot on Mars. The celebration continues later this summer on July 20, 2019, the anniversary of the moon landing, when the JFK Library will be hosting a ""Space Fest."" The event will include a series of activities that will pay tribute to this incredible moment in history.",science,CBS News,left
connecticut-based women's rights and gender equality groups voice support for transgender high school athletes after title ix complaint filed,"Fifteen Connecticut-based women's rights and gender equality groups have voiced their support for , two transgender track and field athletes named in a recent Title IX complaint. The support comes a week after conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom filed a federal discrimination complaint against the state's policy on transgender athletes on behalf of a group of Connecticut high school athletes, ""As organizations that care deeply about ending discrimination against women and girls, we support laws and policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, including in participation in sports,"" the organizations said in a statement. ""Together, we reject unfounded fears about transgender athletes in our state and reject the suggestion that cisgender women and girls benefit from the exclusion of women and girls who happen to be transgender. Instead, we recognize that all women and girls are harmed when some are denied opportunities to participate in sports because of stereotypes and fear."" The 15 organizations include the ACLU of Connecticut, Connecticut TransAdvocacy, CoalitionConnecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, GLSEN Connecticut, Hartford Psychological Services, Imperial Sovereign Court of All Connecticut, Inc., LiveGirl, NARAL Pro-Choice Connecticut, New Haven Pride Center, outCT, Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, PRIDE New Haven, Q Plus, Triangle Community Center and True Colors. The complaint claimed that cisgender (someone who identifies with their birth sex) female athletes were prevented from top finishes and potentially from college scholarships. The complaint details the successes of transgender athletes Terry Miller of Bloomfield and Andraya Yearwood of Cromwell, both of whom are set to enter their senior years in the fall. Both athletes issued statements last week stating that they ""no longer want to remain silent"" on the matter and that they are simply competing under the rules of the state's governing body of high school athletics. The statement from the organizations pointed out that Connecticut's policy has allowed transgender athletes to compete for years, they have been active members of their schools and communities, and that their successes should be celebrated just as much as much as other female athletes. ""We proudly celebrate Andraya, Terry, and other transgender Connecticut athletes,"" the statement read. ""We applaud the parents, teammates, coaches, athletic directors, school administrators, and others who have welcomed transgender athletes with encouragement and respect. And we fully support Connecticut laws and policies designed to protect equal access to athletics for all women and girls, including those who happen to be transgender."" Glastonbury High track and field athlete Selina Soule, one of the three athletes who the complaint was filed on behalf of, was interviewed on Fox News' 'Tucker Carlson Tonight,' where she stated that Miller and Yearwood prevented her from advancing to State Open finals for the 55 meter dash in in the 2018-19 indoor track and field season, which disallows her to clinch a spot at the New England Championship, where she feels she would have a better opportunity to compete in front of college coaches, though some have attempted to debunk this belief.     ©2019 The Hartford Courant (Hartford, Conn.)

westchester mental health program receives gannett grant,"A nonprofit that provides support for parents whose children have mental health conditions is one of Westchester County's two recipients of a 2019 grant from the Gannett Foundation's A Community Thrives program. The Youth Mental Health Project is receiving $12,500 to expand its Parent Support Network, which holds monthly meetings run by trained facilitators who themselves have gone through raising children with mental health issues. The confidential meetings aim to provide peer support and access to resources for parents who are dealing with or learning about their child's mental health. The local operating grant, given to nonprofits that meet fundraising requirements, will go to train seven to 10 additional facilitators for the program, which meets in White Plains and Yorktown and draws parents from across the region. There's also the possibility of a third location opening in Westchester. ""A child who struggles from mental health struggles for a variety of reasons, and we're really not taught as a society what kinds of things to look for and how best to help kids earlier,"" said Randi Silverman, a Dobbs Ferry resident who is the nonprofit's founder and executive director. ""Our mission is to educate, empower and support families and communities around the issues related to youth mental health.""' A Community Thrives is a grant-making and crowd-funding program from the USA TODAY NETWORK and is part of the Gannett Foundation. A Community Thrives supports nonprofit organizations with projects focused on community building and has helped to contribute more than $6.5 million since 2017. The Gannett Foundation distributed $2,010,000 to projects and organizations in more than 92 U.S. cities this year. Gannett owns The Journal News/lohud and more than 100 other media companies around the country including its flagship USA Today. A Community Thrives grants were also distributed to Gullotta House, a Briarcliff Manor nonprofit that provides food vouchers, scholarships, holiday assistance and other help to Westchester residents facing financial and other hardships. Gullotta House received three bonus challenge grants totaling $8,000. Bonus grants are based on success in various weekly challenges. Matthew Gullotta, founder and president, said the money will be used for food assistance in an area that includes Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Briarcliff Manor, Ossining, Croton-on-Hudson, and Peekskill. As part of it, Gullotta House will hold a series of community dinners for people in need. ""We don't care what your income level is; we care what your hardship is today, now,"" Gullotta said of the organization. GANNETT GRANT: Bronx school to receive A Community Thrives funding for virtual reality technology STEAM: Initiatives, including robotics, get off the ground at Bronx high school thanks to Gannett grant WHITE PLAINS: Hospital unveils new family and behavioral health center For the Youth Mental Health Project, which Silverman began nearly three years ago, the Parent Support Network meetings are held at senior centers, community centers, churches and schools. Silverman said half of all mental health conditions in the country emerge before age 14. Her son was diagnosed with one when he was 9, she said, and the experience led her to start a support group 12 years ago. ""I didn't know if anybody would show up, and 40 parents showed up at that first group,"" she said. Silverman also produced ""No Letting Go,"" a film available on Amazon based on her family's experience, and traveled to talk about childhood mental health. But Silverman felt parents should have a resource where the latest research is shared in plain language and a place to meet with others going through what they are, she said. The Youth Mental Health Project was born. There are now seven affiliates of its Parents Support Network including in New Jersey, Connecticut, on Long Island, and in Oregon. She said the plan is to open more in California and Texas. Anna-Christina Allen, of Dobbs Ferry, was one of the parents who attended support network meetings. She said families grappling with mental-health issues can feel isolated and there had been a lack of support groups for them. ""So the Parent Support Network is crucial,"" Allen said.

"Mayor Lori Lightfoot appoints administrator to lower city's expenses from police lawsuits, other expenses","Jun. 29--Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has hired an Atlanta risk management expert to be the city's chief risk officer, a new position aimed at reducing the high cost of police lawsuits and the city's workers' compensation program. Lightfoot announced Friday the hiring of Tamika Puckett, who's currently Atlanta's director of enterprise risk management. Puckett has experience managing Atlanta's workers' compensation program, as well as its property and casualty insurance programs and the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport's risk management program, the mayor's office said. ""Tamika is an accomplished professional who has proven she is ready to lead this charge and create a proactive, multilayered strategy that will protect the city of Chicago and its residents,"" Lightfoot said in a written statement. During her campaign, Lightfoot often spoke of the need to have more stringent risk management to help lower the cost of the city's lawsuit settlements and other expenses. Puckett said her goal is to save money in those areas so it can be reallocated to other priorities. Puckett will start July 29 with an annual salary of $165,000, according to the mayor's office. Puckett will oversee the city's new risk management office, which ""will coordinate a citywide risk-reduction strategy, implementing initiatives to counter, lessen or remove risk from city policies, programs and operations,"" the mayor's office said. Her initial focus will include finding ways to reduce police lawsuits, which currently cost the city tens of millions of dollars a year, as well as vehicular crashes, property damage and workplace accidents, the mayor's office said. Part of Puckett's task will be in helping to reform the city's $100 million-per-year city workers' compensation program, which for decades largely was handled in secret under the auspices of Ald. Edward Burke, who has pleaded not guilty to federal corruption charges. The city earlier this month transferred day to day control of the system to a private company after a review conducted by an outside auditing firm found that the program did not operate according to industry best practices, staff members were inadequately trained, and it lacked ""comprehensive policies and procedures governing claim handling, which can lead to inconsistent claim outcomes for workers."" On police misconduct settlements, which have plagued the city, Puckett said she wants to review data to figure out a way to reduce the cost of such settlements. ""That's one problem or challenge that I find that may be unique to Chicago in its current state. The idea would be again to partner with all of the stakeholders, analyze the data and come up with some mitigation factors,"" Puckett said. Puckett has a Master of Science in financial management from the University of Maryland and a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Georgia State University, according to the mayor's office. gpratt@chicagotribune.com Twitter @royalpratt ___ (c)2019 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,Chicago Tribune,center
Memorial service planned for Sacramento police officer,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)   Hundreds of law enforcement officials will mourn a rookie Sacramento police officer killed in what authorities described as an ambush while she responded to a domestic violence call. Tara O'Sullivan, 26, had been on the job about six months when she was shot. She is the first Sacramento police offer killed on duty in 20 years. Following the funeral more than 500 police vehicles are expected to join a roughly 30-mile (48-kilometer) procession through California's capital city to a funeral home south of Sacramento. O'Sullivan was helping a woman remove belongings June 19 from a north Sacramento home when she was shot by Adel Sambrano Ramos, prosecutors say. It was 45 minutes before police got to O'Sullivan while a heavily armed Ramos engaged in an hours-long standoff with officers before his capture. O'Sullivan later died at UC Davis Medical Center. In the days after the shooting, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn described O'Sullivan as exemplifying courage. ""She chose to be the difference in our community to assist those who were vulnerable and those who alone could not help themselves,"" Hahn said, according to The Sacramento Bee. Amid questions about the time it took police to reach O'Sullivan, her parents told reporters this week they would never place blame on any of the officers who responded to her shooting. ""We know that this police department provided the best training for Tara. For that we are always grateful,"" said her father, Denis O'Sullivan. Organizers expect Bayside Church Adventure Campus in Roseville, California, will be packed to capacity for O'Sullivan's funeral. A second, overflow viewing site is planned at Destiny Christian Church. A procession from Bayside Church Adventure Campus will return to the community of Elk Grove, proceeding along the highway and past the Sacramento police station where O'Sullivan worked. City officials are warning of major traffic delays along the route of the procession. Ramos, 45, remains behind bars. He made his first appearance in court on Monday facing a murder charge that could lead to the death penalty. Ramos is also charged with attempting to murder O'Sullivan's training officer and illegally possessing two assault-style rifles. He did not enter a plea. The Sacramento jail sent Ramos to a local hospital in the hours before his hearing. Authorities said he wounded himself by smashing his head against a bed frame in his cell. He was later transferred to the jail's psychiatric wing.",crime,Associated Press,center
US women are working longer hours as their sleep and social lives suffer,"United States women spent longer working, caring for their families and doing jobs around the house in 2018 than in previous years. The pay-off? Their social lives, leisure time and even their sleep. That's the conclusion of the annual American Time Use Survey , released Wednesday by the Labor Department. Employed women worked approximately 7 hours and 20 minutes during the typical work day last year   the most time since the survey began in 2003. Men, meanwhile, worked around 7 hours 54 minutes on the average work day, down from eight-and-a-half hours in 2017 and the lowest level since the Great Recession. The research, which is based on ongoing interview surveys by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, points to a narrowing of the gap between the time spent on the job by working men and women. That could be seen as a win for women's increased workplace participation. However, women's increased work hours were met by ongoing household obligations, which continue to disproportionately outweigh those of their male counterparts. Last year, working women spent about half-an-hour more per day on household chores, such as cooking and cleaning, compared to their male counterparts. Working mothers also spent around two hours each day caring for their children   15 minutes more than they did in 2017. Working fathers, on the other hand, typically spent less than an hour-and-a-half on child care in 2018. Those pressures came at the expense of leisure time and sleep, the report found. In 2018, the average working woman spent three hours 45 minutes each day relaxing or exercising, down from the previous year. Working mothers spent about 15 minutes less on such activities. By contrast, working men allocated around four hours 40 minutes to leisure and sports, while fathers enjoyed about four hours downtime each day. Employed women also saw their sleep slip slightly to more than eight-and-a-half hours in 2018 from a previous 2017 high of around eight hours 40 minutes. Meanwhile, the number of sleeping hours working men enjoyed has been up in recent years but still remains lower than women's   at around eight hours 20 minutes.

Team USA star Ali Krieger rips Trump: 'I refuse to respect a man that warrants no respect',"U.S. soccer star Ali Krieger excoriated President Trump in a recent interview, saying she refuses to ""respect a man that warrants no respect."" Her comments came during an interview with CNN on Thursday, in which the U.S. national soccer team player also spoke on her decision to defend her teammate Megan Rapinoe after Trump criticized her last week. ""I feel that staying silent at times can side with the oppressor and I didn't want her to feel like she was having to process this all alone, because a lot of us do have those similar feelings,"" Krieger said. ""I wanted to make sure that as one of her close friends, she didn't feel that and I feel like we're able to focus - as women it's funny, imagine that, we can multitask - on two things at once,"" she continued. ""I refuse to just sit back and watch an abuser, a bully talk like that to my friend and I support her as a friend and I wanted to make sure that I said something that meant something to me and was important to me and that's why I did what I did,"" Krieger added. Last week, Krieger slammed Trump on Twitter for criticizing Rapinoe after she said she would reject an invitation to the White House, saying at the time: ""In regards to the 'President's' tweet today, I know women who you cannot control or grope anger you, but I stand by @mPinoe & will sit this one out as well."" ""I don't support this administration nor their fight against LGBTQ+ citizens, immigrants & our most vulnerable,"" Krieger also tweeted then. Since that incident, Kreiger said she hasn't ""really been on Twitter and focused on him [Trump] at all,"" however. ""More importantly, Barack Obama tweeted at us which I definitely liked so I saw that one and I was really excited about that,"" she told CNN. ""And we all were as well.""",politics,CNN,left
kentucky concealed carry 2019: what to know about new law,"Kentucky will join more than a dozen states with a permitless concealed carry law after Gov. Matt Bevin signed the controversial piece of legislation in March. Senate Bill 150 passed with bipartisan support   and opposition   in both the Kentucky House and Senate before arriving on the governor's desk. The law, which goes into effect June 27, will allow eligible people to carry a concealed gun without getting a permit or completing a background check and safety training. See below for a list of where you can and can't carry a gun. More: Matt Bevin signs bill letting people carry concealed guns without a permit Here's what you should know about the new law. What does the law change? Under the newly signed law, those age 21 and older who meet legal rules for gun ownership can legally carry a concealed firearm without a permit. It also removes an exclusion that prevented individuals from getting a permit if they owed more than a year of child support or had misdemeanor alcohol or drug convictions within three years. Anyone with a felony conviction will still be prohibited from possessing any firearms. What doesn't change? State law has not changed regarding where a person is allowed to have a concealed weapon. Concealed weapons are not allowed: In police stations, sheriff offices, detention facilities and courthouses. In federally owned buildings or buildings that house federal offices. On private property where a sign has been posted. When does it take effect? June 28 What did the law say before? State law previously required people to get a permit before they carried a concealed firearm. The process involved undergoing a background check, taking a six-hour gun safety and training class that required them to pass a written test and hit a life-size target with at least 11 of 20 shots from 21 feet. It also required a mandatory $60 fee, with $20 going to the local sheriff and $40 to the state. Joe Gerth: With concealed carry law, don't whine if you shoot yourself in the crotch Do I still need a permit to concealed carry in another state? Yes. The following states recognize Kentucky's concealed carry permits: Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. The remaining states do not recognize the permit or have different rules altogether. The Kentucky State Police recommends contacting the local law enforcement before traveling to find out if concealed carry laws differ in any way. Can I still get a Kentucky permit? Yes. Kentuckians will still have the option to get a concealed carry permit. They still have to meet the requirements established by the law .

US Soccer star Carli Lloyd was told she wasn't good enough at 21 and was going to quit the sport,"At the 2019 Women's World Cup, U.S. soccer legend Carli Lloyd has already notched two goals   and she'll be looking for more on Friday, when her team faces tournament host France in the quarterfinal match. But Lloyd, 36, who's a two-time Olympic gold medalist and competing in her fourth World Cup, hasn't always been in the spotlight. In fact, she thought her soccer career would be over after graduating from college. ""In my head, I was going to finish my last year at Rutgers and then get a real job,"" Lloyd writes on The Players' Tribune , adding: ""I was going to be an FBI agent. That was my plan."" She was 21 and had just been cut from the under-21 U.S. national team. ""You don't work hard enough,"" the coach told her. ""You aren't fit and I simply can't put you on the roster."" That's when Lloyd was convinced that she was ""totally done with soccer,"" she writes. "" Done done."" Shortly after being cut, she connected with James Galanis, her current coach, who helped get her soccer career back on track. She put in more training hours than ever before, focusing on developing her mental toughness and physical fitness, which, at the time, ""were very, very bad,"" Lloyd admits. ""I fought for the next five years to keep the dream alive,"" she continues. ""I fought my way back into the U-21 team and this time to be a pivotal player, and then into the senior team, and then to cement myself into the starting 11, and then onto the 2007 World Cup and 2008 Olympic team."" In the 2008 Olympic gold medal match, Lloyd scored the game-winning goal. But there have been more setbacks since then, the veteran says: In the 2011 World Cup final, she missed a penalty kick and ""felt like I let the team down,"" she writes. The next year, she lost her starting spot on the team right before the 2012 Olympics. As with every setback she's faced throughout her career, Lloyd responded by training more: ""Those three years between the 2012 Olympics and the 2015 World Cup, I was working as hard as I ever have in my life."" It paid off: She helped lead the U.S. to a 2015 World Cup title by netting a hat trick. ""Every single day I have been grinding away to become better,"" says Lloyd, adding: ""A part of me loves the struggle, and a part of me hates the struggle. But all of me is all about the struggle, because without it, there would be no truly great moments.""

elmwood park nj principal: councilman not welcome at graduation,"ELMWOOD PARK   The borough's newest councilman was sworn in last week and has already been caught up in a controversy. Councilman Francesco Fasolo was told Wednesday night that he would not be welcome to attend Elmwood Park Memorial High School's graduation ceremony, as is customary for council members, because it would be ""awkward."" Fasolo, a non-tenured history teacher at Memorial High School, is not being kept on for next school year. ""Your recent appointment to the Council is a great accomplishment and a very honorable duty,"" high school Principal David Warner wrote in an email Wednesday night. ""However, it has also created an awkward situation due to the decision not to renew your employment as a staff member at the high school. Therefore, I feel that it would not be appropriate to extend an invitation to you for this years graduation."" Although the principal did a quick about-face on Thursday, sending a second email inviting Fasolo to attend Friday's event, Fasolo says he's not going. Fasolo said the decision to not retain him for next year was not because of anything he did, and that not including him at the graduation was a disservice to both the community and the district. He said this year's graduating class was the first class that he taught four years ago, and that he has been with them throughout their high school journey. Fasolo said he responded to the initial email and expressed his dissatisfaction as well as his interest in attending. Fasolo now says Warner has made his attendance a spectacle that would take away attention from the students who deserve the spotlight.

""I wish them the utmost success in all their future endeavors."" Warner, in his second email, said he was thinking of Fasolo's best interests, and his potential ""discomfort,"" when he asked him not to attend. Councilman Joseph Dombrowski called the principal's conduct disrespectful to both Fasolo and the governing body as a whole. ""I've been on the council for five and a half years, so that's five graduations,"" he said. ""We've been invited every time as a whole. This is not something that is done piecemeal."" Dombrowski went on to say that Fasolo's employment in the district and his position on the governing body are separate and he acknowledged that it is up to the school to decide whom to retain on staff. Superintendent Anthony Iachetti and Warner did not respond to requests for comment. Fasolo was appointed to the Borough Council on June 13 and sworn in at a special meeting moments later. He is filling the seat left vacant when Daniel Golabek moved into the mayor's post, taking over from Frank Caramagna after his arrest .

The Trump administration's new Europe threat ended a moment of global trade calm after just 2 days,"The US is threatening to expand tariffs on Europe as part of a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies. The move raised tensions with a major trade partner just days after the Trump administration reached a temporary ceasefire with China. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have been locked in a separate trade dispute for more than a year, but progress toward a lasting agreement has proven challenging . Visit Markets Insider for more stories. The US is threatening to expand tariffs on Europe as part of a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, raising tensions with a major trade partner just days after reaching a temporary ceasefire with China. The US Trade Representative said in a statement late Monday it would consider targeting $4 billion worth of additional products from the European Union, including cheese, pasta, coffee, whiskey and chemicals. That would be in addition to $21 billion worth of EU imports threatened with tariffs in April. The move marks the latest move by the US to retaliate against EU aircraft subsidies. The two sides have been in a standoff over EU-based Airbus and US-based Caterpillar for nearly a decade, with each country claiming that the aircraft companies are illicitly aided by government funds. ""This only adds to the trade tensions but in reality does not change anything,"" said Justin Dubon, a spokesman for Airbus. ""That is not creating a healthy environment for working towards a negotiated solution and risks a wide variety of industries on both sides of the Atlantic to arrive in a lose lose situation.""

The proposed tariffs are subject to arbitration at the World Trade Organization, which is tasked with determining the value of US countermeasures. The USTR said a public comment period on the tariffs is scheduled for August 5. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have been locked in a separate trade dispute for more than a year, but progress toward a lasting agreement has proven challenging . ""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome,"" a spokesman for the EU executive said of the aircraft conflict on Tuesday, according to Reuters . The escalation comes days after the US and China reached a temporary trade truce at the G20 summit in Japan, agreeing on Saturday to restart negotiations and delaying a major escalation in the yearlong tariff dispute between the largest economies. The agreement, which delayed $300 billion worth of duties that Trump had proposed, sent financial markets to record highs on Monday. Following the USTR announcement, US stocks drifted lower early Tuesday.

Kentucky students lose appeal in chickenpox vaccination case,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - More than two dozen Catholic school students and their parents have lost their initial appeal in challenging a Kentucky health department's efforts to control a chickenpox outbreak they claim infringed on their religious beliefs. A three-judge panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals sided with a trial court judge who ruled in April that the Northern Kentucky Health Department acted within its authority. The health agency canceled extracurricular activities and later imposed a temporary ban on school attendance for unvaccinated students as the chickenpox outbreak spread. RELATED: Unvaccinated Kentucky student banned from school over chicken pox is suing health department ""The commonwealth has a compelling interest in taking limited and temporary steps to control an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease,"" the appeals court panel said last Friday. The ruling applied to the trial judge's refusal to impose a temporary injunction on behalf of the Catholic school students attending Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and Assumption Academy who - along with their parents - challenged the regional health department's actions. Attorney Christopher Wiest, who represents the students and parents, said Monday he will appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court. The appeals court ruling was ""extraordinarily deferential to the trial court,"" he said, adding that the health department ""targeted our clients for their religious beliefs and ... retaliated against protected First Amendment speech."" RELATED: Teen defies anti-vaxx mom, gets vaccinated after turning 18 The health department's attorney, Jeff Mando, said Monday that the ruling ""underscored the authority of local health departments to take reasonable measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease and protect public health."" The appeals court ""recognized that this case was never really about the exercise of religious freedom. It was about preventing and controlling the spread of a contagious disease,"" he said. The students have cited religious objections to the chickenpox vaccine, claiming the original cells from which the vaccine was developed came from aborted fetus cells decades ago. RELATED: Kentucky student suing over anti-vaccination rights gets chickenpox More than 80% of students at the two schools are not vaccinated against chickenpox. Their parents signed documents exercising their right to a religious exemption from vaccination. When a chickenpox outbreak occurred earlier this year at the schools, the health department initially ordered that extracurricular activities be temporarily canceled. In March, as the illness spread, the health agency imposed the temporary ban on school attendance for unvaccinated students until 21 days after the onset of a rash for the last ill student or staff member. The appeals court said there was no evidence that the health department required that parents have their children vaccinated. RELATED: VERIFY: Are vaccines made from aborted fetuses? The legal fight began when a student wasn't allowed to play basketball because he wasn't vaccinated for chickenpox. The other students and their parents joined the lawsuit. Chickenpox is a contagious disease that causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness and fever, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It recommends two doses of chickenpox vaccine for children, adolescents and adults who have never had chickenpox and were never vaccinated, according to its website. RELATED: Governor Bevin says his children did not receive chickenpox vaccine Complications from chickenpox can include bacterial infections, pneumonia and encephalitis - inflammation of the brain, according to the CDC. Complications aren't common in healthy people with the disease, it says, but high risk groups for complications due to a serious case of chickenpox can include infants, adolescents, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.",health,Associated Press,center
How visions of the Moon inspired centuries of storytellers,"By landing on the Moon in 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin arrived at a place which, up until that point, had been the stuff of fantasy. But even after they transformed fantasy into fact, it is a place that continues to capture the imagination of storytellers, as it has for centuries. Literature, novels, cinema... from antiquity to the present, the Moon has been the object of any number of imaginary expeditions. As far back as the second century BC, the satirist Lucian of Samosata, in ""True Stories"", imagined a voyage to the Moon that saw the author and his fellow travellers find the King of the Moon caught up in a war with the King of the Sun. In the 17th century, French writer Cyrano de Bergerac -- the real one, not the character in Edmond Rostand's famous play -- wrote a tale titled ""The Other World: Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon"". Baron Munchausen travelled to the Moon in a flying boat in German writer Rudolf Erich Raspe's 1785 fantasy. And the 17th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler imagined demons on the Moon in his story titled ""The Dream"". In more modern times, science fiction pioneer H.G. Wells imagined a sophisticated race of insect-like creatures living below the satellite's surface in ""The First Men on the Moon"". Wells's adventurers reached the Moon using a substance that negated the forces of gravity. Verne, in his 1865 tale ""From the Earth the Moon"", was a little less fanciful, shooting his travellers across space in a giant cannon. A century or so later Armstrong, travelling back from the Moon, referred to Verne's tale in one of his television broadcasts. More recently still, one of Herge's 1950s Tintin adventures featured a visit to the Moon -- and even Snowy, his loyal dog, got a spacesuit. Changing face of the Moon Cinema versions of the Moon have been equally fanciful. In George Melies extraordinary 1902 work ""A Trip to the Moon"", the travellers find giant mushrooms and excitable natives. He follows Verne with a cannon-propelled space capsule -- and a splashdown at sea on their return. As technology brought the possibility of a lunar flight closer, that seemed to dampen the market for the more fanciful lunar tales. Classic sci-fi writer Robert Heinlein still used the Moon as the setting for his 1966 novel ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"". But by this time, humans inhabit it -- and Heinlein's tale is about the revolt of the lunar colony against rule from Earth. And just a year before the real Moon landings, Stanley Kubrick's epic 1968 film ""2001"" has astronauts at an outpost on the Moon finding a mysterious obelisk there. Here, as in Clarke's original story, the Moon has become little more than the stage for something far more important. Perhaps what the 1969 Apollo mission to the Moon did was not so much end the telling of tales about the satellite as change the kind of stories being told. After the Apollo landings, the Moon became a focus for pop culture. The heroes of the achingly kitsch 1970s science fiction television series ""Space 1999"" are based on the Moon -- and have to cope with a nuclear accident that knocks it out of orbit and sends them hurtling into space. The Moon also featured in any number of comic-book adventures and cartoon series from the 1970s onwards. David Bowie released his Kubrick-inspired classic 1969 single ""Space Oddity"" the same month as the Moon landings. A generation later, in the 2013 version, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield played his cover version of the song from the International Space Station. And in 2009 Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, broke into the cinema mainstream with his cult hit -- sci-fi puzzler ""Moon"".",science,BBC News,center
Ball in Europe's court on nuclear deal's future: Iranian state TV,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The ball is in Europe's court to shield Iran from U.S. sanctions and prevent it from further scaling back compliance with its nuclear agreement with world powers, Iranian state TV said on Saturday, with days remaining on Tehran's ultimatum. Iran's envoy to a meeting of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord said on Friday that European countries had offered too little at last-ditch talks to persuade Tehran to back off from its plans to breach limits imposed by the deal. Iran stopped complying on May 8 with some commitments in the nuclear deal after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions. Tehran said it would suspend further obligations under the deal after 60 days. ""The ball is in Europe's court. Are Paris, London and Berlin going to again waste a chance under the influence of (U.S. President Donald) Trump, or use the remaining opportunity to fulfill their promises and act on their commitments under the (nuclear deal),"" Iranian state TV said in a commentary. Iran has repeatedly criticized delays in European countries setting up a trading mechanism that aims to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions. On Friday, Britain, France and Germany said the trade channel, INSTEX, was finally up and running. Meanwhile, the United States deployed F-22 stealth fighters to Qatar, as tensions mounted after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Tehran said the unmanned U.S. aircraft was in its air space, which Washington denied. ""These aircraft (F-22 Raptors) are deployed to Qatar for the first time in order to defend American forces and interests,"" the U.S. Air Force said on its regional website. Separately, the Iranian foreign minister said Iran would resist any U.S. sanctions, just as it persevered during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war when the forces of then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein launched chemical attacks, including on an Iranian town. ""We persevered then, and will now,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on the anniversary of the 1987 chemical bombing of the border town of Sardasht, which killed at least 130 people. ""We'll never forget that Western world supported & armed Saddam ... Security Council never condemned his gassing of our people,"" Zarif wrote.

correction: tax incentives story,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP)   In a story July 7 about New Jersey tax credits, The Associated Press erroneously reported when the third public meeting of Gov. Phil Murphy's task force would be held. The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, not Monday. A corrected version of the story is below: Public gets turn to talk tax credits at next hearing The public is getting chance to weigh in on New Jersey's business tax incentive drama that led to the program's expiration earlier this month By MIKE CATALINI Associated Press TRENTON, N.J. (AP)   The public will get its chance to weigh in on New Jersey's business tax incentive drama that led to the program's expiration earlier this month. A task force investigating tax credits set up by Gov. Phil Murphy is set to hold its third hearing on Tuesday. The public is invited to testify about the programs that have been at the center of a political and policy disagreement in New Jersey's Democrat-led state government. Tax credits enacted under a 2013 bill expired on July 1, and Murphy and lawmakers have disagreed over how to move forward. But the task force also concluded that special interests helped write the legislation to benefit stakeholders. A closer look at the status of the state's tax credits: WHAT'S HAPPENING? The tax incentives may have expired, but they're taking center stage now that the state budget has been enacted. Tuesday's meeting will be the task force's third since Murphy formed the group in January   but it's the first at which the public is invited to testify. The first and second hearings had revelations that made waves. At one hearing, a whistleblower testified that an unidentified firm she worked for said it was considering leaving the state in order to get credits when she knew the company had already decided to stay. The second hearing turned up documents showing that firms connected with influential Democratic political powerbroker George Norcross gave inconsistent responses while applying for credits when asked whether they considered leaving the state, a key requirement in most cases for being awarded credits. That led to Norcross suing Murphy and also petitioning a judge to block the task force's interim report. The judge disagreed, and the report came out. The report concluded that special interests, particularly those linked to Norcross, helped write the legislation to benefit stakeholders, who later did benefit. Norcross disputes the findings and has suggested the task force amounts to a political witch hunt. The task force report was not the only indication of trouble surrounding the credits. A comptroller report in 2019 said the Economic Development Authority, which oversees the credits, couldn't verify whether all requirements were being met before awards were made. An auditor's report in 2017 raised similar concerns. ___ WHAT ARE OFFICIALS DOING? Lawmakers sent Murphy a six-month extension of the tax incentive programs, but the governor has vowed to veto it. The bill's sponsors and backers say they want the time to help come up with a successor program and don't want the state to be at a disadvantage compared to neighboring states. Murphy says he won't endorse an extension and instead proposed a new program that caps awards, among other changes. The Legislature is also set to hold its own hearings on the incentives, though the first hearing was postponed. Within the administration, treasury officials said they were ""alarmed"" at how little oversight previous administrations had over the sale of tax credits among businesses, which is allowed by law. Officials said they set up an online system to monitor the sales, which cover about 70% of credits awarded. ___ WHAT'S NEXT? The path forward is murky. Murphy said last week that he was ""optimistic"" he could find common ground with legislators ""sooner rather than later,"" but his relationship with Senate President Steve Sweeney, in particular, is frosty. The pair clashed during the budget over taxes, and Sweeney is a close friend of Norcross.",politics,Associated Press,center
"senate confirms judge who attacked roe v. wade, called being transgender 'a delusion'","WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Wednesday to confirm Matthew Kacsmaryk to a lifetime federal judgeship despite his record of hostility toward LGBTQ rights and abortion rights. The Senate voted 52-46 to put Kacsmaryk, 42, onto the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Every Democrat present voted no. Every Republican present but one, Susan Collins (Maine), voted yes. The full vote tally is here . LGBTQ and reproductive rights groups have been protesting Kacsmaryk's nomination for more than a year because of his extreme views on both fronts. Last week, dozens of human rights groups signed a letter opposing him. Kacsmaryk fought against protections for LGBTQ people in employment , housing and health care . He called including protections for LGBTQ people in the Violence Against Women Act ""a grave mistake."" In 2015, when Utah passed nondiscrimination protections, Kacsmaryk called the law "" a bad idea "" because it suggests that discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity should be taken as seriously as other forms of discrimination. He signed a 2016 letter that called being transgender ""a delusion."" On reproductive rights, Kacsmaryk opposed the employer contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act and played a lead role in opposing a Washington state law that required pharmacists to provide birth control to women. He also criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade , describing that case as one in which ""seven justices of the Supreme Court found an unwritten 'fundamental right' to abortion hiding in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the shadowy 'penumbras' of the Bill of Rights, a celestial phenomenon invisible to the non-lawyer eye."" (What?) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wondered aloud how anyone could expect Kacsmaryk to be a fair and impartial judge. He cited bizarre comments Kacsmaryk has made about the Equality Act, a sweeping LGBTQ anti-discrimination bill. ""He labeled the Equality Act a 'public affirmation of the lie that the human person is an autonomous blob of Silly Putty, unconstrained by nature or biology, and that marriage, sexuality, gender identity, and even the unborn child must yield to the erotic desires of liberated adults,'"" Schumer said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""Why on earth is this man a nominee for a lifetime appointment? Why would my colleagues want to drape black robes over these bigoted views? Our judicial system is designed to protect liberties, not denigrate them."" Kacsmaryk, who is the deputy general counsel for First Liberty Institute, a right-wing Christian advocacy group, sounds like a lot of President Donald Trump's other judicial nominees   young, right-wing ideologues , the vast majority of whom are white men . But even within the homogeneity of Trump's court picks, Kacsmaryk stands out. ""He is one of Trump's most extreme nominees,"" said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and an expert on judicial nominations. ""His public statements about LGBTQ people and about abortion suggest that in litigation involving LGBTQ and abortion rights, litigants will have difficulty believing that he will fairly resolve their cases."" Kacsmaryk does have something in common with nearly all of Trump's judicial nominees: He's a member of the conservative Federalist Society, which has been driving Trump's judicial selection process and funneling anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ nominees to the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has made judicial confirmations his top priority while Trump is in the White House. In the past two and a half years, he has ushered through the confirmations of two Supreme Court justices, 76 district judges and 41 circuit judges. That's more circuit judges than any president has gotten through by this point in a first term. To put that into perspective: 1 in 5 of all of the nation's current circuit judges was nominated by Trump. This article originally appeared on HuffPost .",science,Business Insider,center
US maple syrup production up despite shorter season,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP)   U.S. maple syrup production increased slightly this year, even though the sap-collecting season was shorter than last year's, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The country produced 4.2 million gallons (16 million liters) of the pancake topper, up 1% from 2018. Vermont, the country's leading producer, made more than 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters). New York, which yielded 820,000 gallons (3.1 million liters), followed, according to the data released this week. Then came Maine with 580,000 gallons (2.2 million liters) and Wisconsin with 270,000 gallons (1 million liters). Michigan ended up with 195,000 gallons (738,155 liters) and Pennsylvania produced 157,000 gallons (594,310 liters). New Hampshire, the only state in the available data to see a decline in production, yielded 148,000 gallons (560,241 liters). Total production numbers were not available for some other maple-producing states. The maple season requires warm days and nights below freezing for the sap to flow in maple trees. The sap is then boiled into syrup. This year's season lasted an average of 30 days in the syrup-producing states, compared with 42 days in 2018, the USDA said. In Vermont, the season started later than in recent years, worrying some producers that it would be too short. But the state ended up producing more syrup than in 2018. It also had 330,000 more taps in trees this year for a total of 6 million taps that helped to draw more sap. Amanda Voyer, executive director of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, said she was even shocked by the amount produced. A number of sugar makers reported one or two record-breaking days of sap flow, she said. ""You can have one day where it's trickling sap or you can have one day where it's coming out gangbusters,"" she said. ""There just happened to be some really solid days.""",environmental issues,AP,center

See how this YouTube star turned her Tesla Model 3 into a pickup truck,"Elon Musk has promised to unveil Tesla's first-ever electric pickup truck by the end of this summer. But at least one Tesla fan was too eager to wait   so, she made her own. Simone Giertz is a Swedish-born YouTube host known mostly for making comical online videos chronicling her attempts to build what she calls ""sh---y robots."" Giertz, whose channel has over 1.6 million followers, regularly builds robots that perform everyday tasks less than adequately, like a helmet that sloppily brushes your teeth or an alarm clock that wakes you up with a rubber hand smacking your face. But on Tuesday, Giertz posted a new video to YouTube that shows her latest engineering effort   converting a Tesla Model 3 sedan into a pickup truck   and it actually appears to be a success. The 31-minute video shows Giertz, along with mechanic Marcos Ramirez , designer Laura Kampf and car refurbisher Rich Benoit (of the YouTube channel ""Rich Rebuilds""), removing the electric sedan's rear window and literally cutting through the Model 3 frame to remove the back end of its roof. Giertz and her team of engineers and designers then strip out the Tesla's backseat and trunk in order to install a pickup bed in the now-open back of the car. Giertz says they spent over a year planning the project, which included buying a new Model 3 (which has a base price of $35,000) from Tesla. ""One of the initial designs we had was to essentially strip everything from the midway and back, and just put in a flatbed,"" Giertz told Wired, ""But I didn't like the look of that.

She even calls the ""Truckla"" her ""absolute dream car.""

California bill limiting vaccine exemptions watered down after Gavin Newsom objects,"SACRAMENTO   California legislation to tighten rules on medical exemptions for childhood vaccinations was watered down by its author Tuesday after Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested the original proposal went too far. SB276, as originally drafted, would require the state Department of Public Health to approve every request for a medical exemption to a child's immunization schedule   taking the sole power to grant a waiver away from individual doctors. State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, who proposed the legislation, unveiled amendments Tuesday to dramatically scale back the bill's aim, so the department's approval would be required only in limited cases. Newsom said this month that he has ""concerns about a bureaucrat making a decision that is very personal."" While he didn't explicitly say he would veto SB276, his comments put the bill's fate in jeopardy. Pan, a pediatrician, had been meeting with Newsom about a possible compromise before the bill is heard in an Assembly committee Thursday. The Senate has already approved the original measure. Pan's amendments would require state public health officials to review immunizations if a school has an immunization rate less than 95% or an individual doctor grants more than five exemptions in a calendar year. In those circumstances, the state could revoke exemptions that it finds are fraudulent or inconsistent with medical guidelines. Pan said the amendments were the result of negotiations with the Newsom administration. He said the revamped proposal would allow for legitimate medical waivers while cracking down on doctors who issue inappropriate exemptions, creating the risk of a disease outbreak. ""I appreciate that the governor has worked with me in crafting a California solution to halting the abuse of medical exemptions that endanger our children,"" Pan said in a statement. ""The governor recognizes that we need to ensure that children who truly need medical exemptions get them and they will be safe in their schools with community immunity.""

remington storefront challenge brings a fresh look to a neglected corner,"An old Cities Service gas station, later a pizza delivery service, is being transformed this summer along the busy 29th Street corridor in Remington. Look for Cahoots Brothers, located between The Dizz restaurant and the R. House, to open later this year. The background needs to be told. There was a community competition to find a new use for what is a highly visible but aesthetically challenged corner. An ugly duckling 1940s filling station later made into a pizza shop was picked to be a makeover candidate for a vacant retail property. A neighborhood committee picked a pair of retailers for two empty storefronts after retailers submitted their proposals. The winners, picked from 100 applicants, are getting two years of free rent. Cahoots Brothers is an art collective of five guys who want to make a difference in doing what they do best. Kyle Johnson is a goldsmith who now works on Read Street in Mount Vernon. Alex Bell is a ceramicist and photographer. Arvay Adams is a chain stitcher who currently works out of a Guilford Avenue garage near Union Memorial Hospital. Warner Blak grew up on Queensbury Avenue in Park Heights and works with his friend Kyle. And Greg Morton, who grew up on East Preston Street near Edison Highway and attended Polytechnic Institute and Morehouse College, is a financial adviser. ""Baltimore has shown me its good side and I've come home to it,"" said Johnson, who was born in Petersburg, Va., and studied architecture at Morgan State University. He speaks of taking jewelry ""into a different realm"" and mentions the designs of Louis C. Tiffany. ""When you visit the Walters Museum,"" he said, ""you see that Tiffany was not just a jewelry maker. And people like Tiffany inspired me. And I like it when I'm inspired and outside my comfort zone."" His friend Warner Blak, who does marketing for Cahoots Brothers, described the mission: ""We want to be the launch pad for local makers."" Their aim is to make the corner of 29th and Remington into a retailing marketplace for non-traditional wares. ""I felt a kinship with these guys,"" said Dan Wells, who owns the Old Bank Barbers in Hampden and Old Market Barbers in Remington and sat on the selection panel that picked Cahoots Brothers. ""They needed a break and they have the passion,"" Wells said. ""When they did their presentation to the Remington community, I saw the craftsmanship in their pottery, the jewelry and chain stitching   and was very impressed. Baltimore does not have the retail diversity it should. And I like the idea they are creating."" Chain stitching, Arvay Adams explains, is the machine embroidery work that appears on sports jerseys, bowling shirts and industrial uniform clothing. He uses an 80-year-old sewing machine, a Singer 114-W, to affix the letters to ""Bethlehem Steel"" on workshirts. He studied painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and changed careers about 18 months ago. And while his Cahoots Brothers' colleague mentions Tiffany, Adams reflects on Baltimore's blue-collar industrial history, work clothes and recreational garb. He's made replica jerseys for the Negro League, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad uniforms and numerous sports teams. He focuses on historic sports work and the World War II period. The corner of 29th Street and Remington Avenue has an automotive history. The Cahoots Brothers site was the former Willis Cities Service gas station and before that a DuPont de Nemours chemical company warehouse. Jarmon Motors, which sold Pontiacs, was across the street in what is now the R. House. Another auto agency, owned by Guilford resident Charles Reeves, was across the street. The Remington selection panel also picked Codex Club, owned by Andrea Chen, who makes printed products in a space at Remington Row, 2700 Remington Ave. Other sponsors in the challenge were the Johns Hopkins University, Seawall Development and the Howard Bank, in addition to the Remington neighborhood group. jacques.kelly@baltsun.com",science,Associated Press,center
Google Maps can now warn you about how crowded buses and trains are,"Late buses and crowded trains can make commuting in urban areas more frustrating than it has to be, and Google is trying to help. On Thursday the tech giant announced a new feature in Google Maps that will help you avoid crowded buses, so you can make better-informed transportation decisions to ""be on time."" The Android and iOS apps are being updated with traffic data that shows how crowded a bus typically is at a specific time of day when you're planning to ride it. The data is coming after months of Google asking passengers who use the app questions about the level of crowdedness during their transit trips. Mobile privacy: Apple says it doesn't track you, but apps on iPhone sure do Workplace activism: More workers, like Wayfair walkout protesters, are speaking up about company policies Now that the search engine behemoth has gathered enough data to offer predictions, it's launching the new feature in many metro areas around the globe. Traveling this summer? 5 ways to save money and nab last-minute flight deals Google is watching: Check your settings if you don't want it tracking every move How does it work? In select cities, when you search for a route using the navigation app you will see messages like, ""Usually standing room only"" if passengers have previously rated the trip to be crowded. In addition, Google is launching real-time traffic delays for buses in areas where commuters don't have access to live information from local transit agencies. ""You'll now be able to see if your bus will be late, how long the delay will be, and more accurate travel times based on live traffic conditions along your route,"" the company said in a blog post . ""You'll also see exactly where the delays are on the map so you know what to expect before you even hop on your bus."" This comes after Apple announced major changes to its Google Maps competitor earlier this month. During Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the iPhone maker revealed that the new version of Apple Maps will give you an option to save the addresses of places you frequent such as restaurants, your home or office. You can then organize your locations into categories like ""Places to go with kids"" and share them with others if you wish. The app also got a more detailed appearance and a new binoculars ""Look Around"" tool that gives you a 3D, street-level look at the locations you're searching.

Orphaned Sea Otters Get A New Home At The Shedd Aquarium,"CHICAGO (CBS)   The Shedd Aquarium is now home to two orphaned sea otters who were found in California. The pups, who arrived earlier this week, were originally rescued by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The animals are known as Pups 870 and 872. They've been cared for by the Shedd Aquarium's animal care and veterinarian teams. According to the aquarium, the sea otters will be away from the public as they stay in the Regenstein Sea Otter Nursery for a few months as they continue to grow and, according to Shedd ""reach important development milestones and build bonds with the care staff and the other otters before they are officially introduced to the otter habitat."" Both pups are male and are about a week apart. 872 is estimated to be about nine weeks old weighing a little over 13 pounds and 870 is a little older, at about 10 weeks, weighing 10 pounds. ""While it's never good news to hear that an animal has been orphaned or in need of rescue, Shedd Aquarium stands ready to step in to assist   whether that's rehabilitating and releasing animals, in this case, providing a safe home for those that need it,"" said Peggy Sloan, chief animal operations officer at Shedd Aquarium. When the animals were originally taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service deemed the animals ""non-releasable."" That means the pups were not likely raised by their mothers and taught how to survive in the wild. So they may not have survived if they were immediately released into their natural habitat. ""These two pups kept us busy from the moment we arrived,"" said Tracy Deakins, senior trainer at Shedd Aquarium who accompanied the otter pups on their trip to Chicago. ""It was an incredibly rewarding experience to see all that Monterey Bay does for sea otters and to bring these two pups to their new home here."" Traditionally, sea otters usually stay with their mother until they are at least eight months old. The animals have to eat at least 25% of its body weight ""to maintain a high metabolic rate, which keeps their internal body temperature at 100 degrees."" Male sea otters can reach a weight of up to 90 pounds. The animals' diet can be made up of abalone, clams, crabs, octopus and sea urchins. The Shedd Aquarium said it plans to provide updates on the development of the pups, when names will be chosen and when the public will have a chance to check out the cute creatures.",environmental issues,CBS,left
FBI got tip about Dallas courthouse shooter in 2016,"DALLAS (AP)   The FBI received a call about three years ago about the U.S. Army veteran who opened fire on a courthouse in downtown Dallas, a federal law enforcement official said Thursday. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers after he began shooting at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. The 22-year-old was armed with a high-powered rifle and more than 150 rounds of ammunition, but there were no other serious injuries or deaths. The FBI did not investigate Clyde after the July 1, 2016 call because it did not contain a specific threat, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the shooting probe is ongoing. The official said a member of Clyde's family called a national tip line to say Clyde was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. Clyde's mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that her son's half-brother had called the FBI with concerns. Attempts to reach Clyde's family members by phone were unsuccessful Thursday. The call came while Clyde was enlisted. He served as an infantryman from August 2015 to February 2017 but was never deployed to a war zone, according to the Army. He was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. The FBI said Clyde was honorably discharged, but his short period of service suggests he left the military earlier than planned. The Army has declined to say why Clyde was discharged, citing privacy laws. More than a month before a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high school in 2018, the FBI received a tip warning that Nikolas Cruz wanted to kill people and was planning a school shooting. The tipster also said Cruz owned guns, was acting erratically and had made disturbing social media posts. The FBI said it should've assessed that as a ""threat to life"" and referred it to agents in Florida, but that never happened. After the Parkland shooting, the FBI made changes to its tip line protocols. Additional employees and supervisors were brought on and more calls now need to be reviewed by a supervisor before they are closed. Earlier this year, the FBI received a tip about a threatening social media post that was made by the gunman who opened fire at a synagogue near San Diego, but the bureau said it received the information too late to identify the suspect. The FBI was notified through its tip website and phone line just before the shooting and some of the tips included links to the post but didn't offer specific information about its author or the location threatened. In that case, the FBI said its employees immediately acted to identify who wrote the post, but the shooting took place before they finished. ___ Associated Press writers Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Mike Balsamo in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.",crime,Associated Press,center
"Yes, there's a total solar eclipse coming next week ... in South America","If you've still got leftover solar eclipse fever from 2017, don't fret: There's another one coming next week. But there's a catch   you'll have to hop on a plane to see it. On July 2, a total eclipse of the sun will be visible in portions of South America, weather permitting. The path of the eclipse, which moves from west to east, ""starts in the South Pacific near Pitcairn Island and ends over land, having touched just two countries: Chile and Argentina,"" according to Astronomy magazine . Specifically, the sun will disappear along a narrow track that stretches from Chile's coast to just south of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital and largest city. ""Totality will first make landfall in South America on the coast of Chile near the city of La Serena at 4:39 p.m. on July 2,"" Space.com said. La Serena, population 200,000, is about 250 miles north of Santiago, Chile's capital and largest city. Santiago residents will have to drive over 5 hours north to see the spectacle, Astronomy magazine said. After that, the moon's shadow will cross the Andes Mountains and graze the city of San Juan, Argentina. Then, as the eclipse moves east across Argentina, it will slide just south of the cities of Cordoba and Buenos Aires before heading back out to the Atlantic Ocean just before sunset at 5:40 p.m. Though the total eclipse will be visible in the southern suburbs of Buenos Aires, the sun will be setting and thus very close to the horizon. As a refresher, during a total solar eclipse, the moon blocks the sun, turning day to an eerie twilight. This is what the corona will likely resemble during the #eclipse on July 2nd. Why not a more dynamic corona? We're at solar minimum, meaning   save for connecting field lined between the poles   we have few regions of magnetic flux or any coronal loops. https://t.co/0YAq3GT9QI pic.twitter.com/mM4qVtVR94   Matthew Cappucci (@MatthewCappucci) June 22, 2019 If you do venture down to South America, keep this in mind: Never look directly at the sun, except during the brief moments of totality. NASA said the only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as ""eclipse glasses. It's the Earth's first total solar eclipse ""since the Great American Total Eclipse of 2017,"" according to EclipseWise.com . Here in the U.S., the next total solar eclipse will be on April 8, 2024, and it will be visible from Texas to New England.

NY lawmakers eye decriminalization after legal pot stalls,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP)   Lawmakers in New York state moved Thursday to eliminate criminal penalties for public possession and use of marijuana after efforts to legalize pot stalled. The measure would reduce low-level criminal charges for unlawful possession of marijuana to a violation, which comes with a fine similar to a parking ticket. The penalty would be $50 for possessing under one ounce of pot or $200 for between one and two ounces. In an effort to address decades of racial disparities when it comes to drug arrests, the bill would also allow for the expungement of past convictions for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The measure passed the state Senate Thursday evening and was expected to get a vote in the Assembly before lawmakers adjourn for the year. Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-the Bronx and the bill's sponsor, said misdemeanor convictions for pot possession can affect a person for life, ""limiting their access to housing, access to education, affecting their ability to obtain employment."" The bill emerged as a fallback option when legislation that would have legalized, regulated and taxed marijuana sales fizzled on Wednesday after lawmakers couldn't reach consensus on key details, such as how tax revenue would be used and how local communities would decide whether they want to host dispensaries. Lawmakers who had hoped to vote on legalization said the decriminalization bill may be a prelude to full legalization next year. ""We will get there,"" said Sen. Diane Savino, D-Staten Island. ""This is one step on the path. We will get there."" New York state began rolling back criminal penalties for marijuana in the 1970s, but current law allowed police to arrest people for having pot in public, a wrinkle that legalization advocates say has often been used to target young racial minorities. Estimates are that nearly 600,000 New Yorkers could benefit from the expungement of past marijuana convictions. Opposition to the change was led by Republican lawmakers who said they worried that decriminalizing marijuana would increase traffic crashes and drug use by minors. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed his own plan for legalization earlier this year. He said he'll sign the decriminalization bill, noting that he called for a similar step five years ago. ""It's not legalization,"" he said on public radio Wednesday. ""But it is decriminalization and it's a major, major accomplishment.""",legal arguments,AP,center
U.S. Supreme Court spurns Virginia Republicans in racial gerrymandering case,"Video by NBC News WASHINGTON, June 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed Republican legislators in Virginia a defeat, leaving in place a ruling that invalidated state electoral districts they drew because they weakened the clout of black voters in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The justices, in a 5-4 decision, sidestepped a ruling on the merits of the case. They instead found that the Republican-led state House of Delegates lacked the necessary legal standing to appeal a lower court ruling that invalidated 11 state House districts for racial discrimination. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat and the state's top law enforcement official, opposed the appeal and argued that the Republican legislators were not entitled to act on behalf of the state in the case. The Supreme Court's action let stand a 2018 ruling by a federal three-judge panel that the 11 districts all violated the rights of black voters to equal protection under the law under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. The state's House of Delegates ""lacks authority to displace Virginia's attorney general as representative of the state,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court's majority. ""In short, Virginia would rather stop than fight on. One house of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process,"" Ginsburg added. The case involved a hot topic for the Supreme Court: a practice called gerrymandering involving the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the Republican legislators were accused of racial gerrymandering to disadvantage black voters. In two other major cases from Maryland and North Carolina, the justices are considering whether courts can curb gerrymandering aimed at purely partisan advantage. They are due to rule in those cases by the end of this month. At issue in the Virginia case was the state legislative map drawn by Republicans after the 2010 national census. The new map is already being used. Since the Virginia maps that were challenged in the case were drawn, Democrats have made gains in Virginia in both state and federal elections. The current governor, Ralph Northam, and attorney general, Mark Herring, both are Democrats. Northam has been involved in a racial controversy of his own this year after a racist photo from his 1984 medical school yearbook page surfaced. Like other U.S. southern states, Virginia has a complicated racial history dating back to the era of slavery. The voters who brought the legal challenge accused Republicans of packing black voters into certain state House districts to diminish their voting power and make surrounding districts more white and more likely to support Republicans. Democrats have accused President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in Virginia and other states of crafting such legislative maps in a way that crams black and other minority voters, who tend to favor Democratic candidates, into certain districts in order to reduce their overall sway in the state.",legal arguments,Reuters,center
judge won't delay sentencing for brendt christensen in murder of chinese scholar yingying zhang,"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (CBS/AP)   A federal judge has denied former University of Illinois doctoral student Brendt Christensen's request to delay sentencing in the kidnapping and murder of visiting Chinese scholar Yingying Zhang. U.S. District Judge James Shadid issued the ruling Wednesday, and set sentencing to begin on Monday. Last week, a federal jury found Christensen guilty of Zhang's kidnapping and death in 2017. It took the jury less than two hours to deliberate before convicting Christensen on three counts: kidnapping resulting in a death and two counts of lying to investigators. The same jury that convicted Christensen will now decide if he'll be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. Christensen's lawyers argued that prosecutors turned over a large amount of victim impact videos at the last minute. They said it would take weeks to translate the videos from Chinese to English. Shadid denied the defense's request to either bar those videos from being presented at sentencing, or delay the sentencing phase. The judge instead told prosecutors to give defense attorneys specific video clips they plan to use at sentencing. Defense attorneys have admitted that Christensen kidnapped and killed Zhang but have disputed some of the evidence and have tried to paint Christensen as a man with mental health and alcohol problems who does not deserve the death penalty. In a defense filing after Christensen's convictions, his lawyers revealed he offered after his arrest to divulge where Zhang's remains are in exchange for a life sentence. A statement from Zhang's family, released by their Chicago-based lawyer, Zhidong Wang, said they were made aware of the offer at the time and told prosecutors they wanted ""truthful"" information from Christensen that would allow them to find the remains and bring them home to China. But they ""were leery"" of the offer because ""he had lied so many times in the past."" ""There was no promise that Yingying's remains would be discovered,"" the statement said. The defense filing doesn't say whether prosecutors seriously considered withdrawing the death penalty option. The timetable also isn't clear: The defense says Christensen made the offer ""within six months"" of his June 30, 2017, arrest; prosecutors had raised the possibility of seeking the death penalty by November 2017 and announced in January 2018 that they would seek it. Law enforcement spent weeks searching for Zhang's body, including at a mine 30 minutes south of the campus in nearby Champaign, but her body was never found. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in central Illinois, Sharon Paul, declined any comment on the defense filing. Prosecutors have said they won't comment on any aspect of the trial until proceedings are over. In a filing late last week, they suggested it won't ever be possible to recover Zhang's remains. Prosecutors considered Christensen's offer, broaching it with Zhang's family. But they say the deal was contingent on ""locating and recovering"" all of Zhang's ""identifiable bodily remains."" They say the plea talks collapsed when it became clear that wouldn't be possible. (© Copyright 2019 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

swannanoa's ex-beacon mill site sold to symmetry financial group,"SWANNANOA   The former site of a Swannanoa blanket manufacturer which at its peak employed thousands of area residents has been sold in a plan clearing the way for development intended to spur community growth. Symmetry Financial Group, an insurance marketing company, acquired this week a 42-acre property on Whitson Avenue, formerly the home of the Beacon Manufacturing Co. plant. Company leaders say they plan to build a new office space for Symmetry and its corporate staff, on which they hope to break ground next year. The acquisition also clears the way for a proposed $26 million indoor sports complex   a plan targeting about 15 acres of the property   as well as future retail, commercial and recreational uses, Symmetry co-owners Brandon Ellison and Casey Watkins said. Watkins said the company views the ex-Beacon site as ""a bit of a blank canvas"" that can serve both Symmetry's needs for a new 30,000 square feet headquarters and the community's long-term interests. ""It was where the town was; that was Swannanoa,"" Watkins said. ""When you turn up Whitson Avenue there past (Native Kitchen and Social Pub), that was where it was all happening. That's going to be an important piece of the puzzle when we think about the future of Swannanoa and the growth of it."" He added, ""Our goal with purchasing the land was to be in a position to make sure it stays on the right track.""

The vacant facility was destroyed by a fire set by homemade pipe bomb the following year. A portion of the site was targeted last year in a presentation commissioned by Eblen Charities and delivered to the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority. BCTDA board member Chip Craig told the board in September the plan calls for an 118,000-square-foot facility, much of which would provide indoor courts for basketball, volleyball and pickleball. Other proposals include a climbing wall, sports performance training space and a sports medicine area. Craig said the facility could drive economic development in Swannanoa for it to become ""a regional destination for sports tourism."" He noted construction on the facility could not begin until 2020 ""at the earliest.""

"Paul Manafort confessed to mortgage fraud charges, Manhattan prosecutors say","A disheveled-looking Paul Manafort limped into a Manhattan courtroom Thursday and pleaded not guilty to a laundry-list of fraud charges   but prosecutors say the former Trump campaign boss has already confessed to some of those very crimes. Shortly after Manafort entered his not guilty plea before Supreme Court Judge Maxwell Wiley, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office filed notice that it plans to use a statement from his federal Washington, D.C., case in his upcoming state trial. The statement, made by Manafort in U.S. District Court on Sept. 14, 2018, shows he has already copped to at least some of the crimes he's now pleading not guilty to, according to the DA's office. ""Mr. Manafort admitted, orally and in writing, to making misrepresentations in mortgage applications for proprieties located in New York, Kings and Suffolk counties to two financial institutions,"" DA prosecutors said in the filing. ""Additionally, Mr. Manafort admitted to making misrepresentations to another financial institution in a loan application."" Manafort's state indictment charges him with 16 counts of mortgage fraud, falsifying business records and conspiracy relating to millions of dollars in loans he took out on his properties in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Long Island. The loans came from two financial institutions, the Citizens Bank and the Federal Savings Bank, according to the DA's office. Despite his apparent confession, the disgraced former Trump campaign chairman said ""not guilty"" when asked in Wiley's courtroom Thursday afternoon how he pleads to the DA's charges. The previously high-flying GOP politico, who made millions working for U.S. presidents and dictators around the world, donned navy blue jail scrubs, white sneakers and had his hands shackled to his waist as he appeared in court. His previously dark hair had turned a whitish gray. As he was led into the courthouse, Manafort did not respond when someone yelled ""traitor"" at him. He managed to crack a grim smile while being led out of the courthouse and taken back to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. Manafort will remain in federal custody for the duration of his state proceedings, according to the Bureau of Prisons. His next court appearance is set for Oct. 9. Vance's charges are meant to ensure that Manafort stays behind bars even if President Trump pardons him. Contrary to Manafort's federal convictions in Washington, D.C., and Virginia   which stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation   Vance's state charges can't be voided by a presidential pardon. Trump hasn't said outright that he's considering a pardon for Manafort. However, the president has said he feels ""very badly"" for his former campaign boss and regularly derides the investigation that brought him down as a partisan ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax."" Manafort, 70, is currently serving a seven and a half year sentence for his federal convictions. He could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted on some of the most serious state charges. Manafort's legal team is contending the DA's charges should be thrown out because his federal cases were based on some of the same conduct, thereby violating New York's so-called double jeopardy laws barring people from being prosecuted for the same crimes twice. ""In our view, the laws in New York do not allow the People to do what they did in this case,"" Manafort lawyer Todd Blanche told reporters outside the courthouse. However, New York laws permit a person to be prosecuted twice for the same act if at least one element of the crimes is distinct.     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,New York Daily News,left

An Uber driver and her community are working to together to help an 89-year-old veteran in need,"Lauren Mulvihill did not know what to expect when she was called to the hospital for an Uber pick up. 89-year-old Ronald Dembner had just been discharged from the hospital with no one to take him home. Last week, Mulvihill drove Dembner from the hospital in Henry County, Georgia, to his home and helped him inside. When she saw the terrible condition of his home, she knew she needed to help. Dembner, who Mulvihill calls Mr. Ronald, is a widower and veteran who now lives alone with his dog King. He has no living family. Mulvihill said that Dembner had not called someone to help clean his house out of fear they would take it away from him. The veteran has been living in squalor. Dembner has his wits about him, but he has a hard time getting around, cleaning the house and picking up after his dog. Mulvihill knew she couldn't clean up the house herself. That's when the single mom went to Facebook to call for help. The response was overwhelming. Dozens of volunteers came forward and began to clean and help strip apart the house. In just a week's time, they have already removed all of the garbage, the old furniture and the old carpet. The next step is painting the walls and putting in new floor. They're also trying to get someone to come fix the mold situation, Mulvihill says the work can be at lot at times but she tries to work one room at a time. The public Facebook group, Helping Mr. Ronald , now has over 800 members. Shaquin Thomas is one of those members. She decided she wanted to spend her birthday, on Thursday, completing acts of kindness   Mr. Ronald's home was her first stop. Thomas owns a catering company in the area and saw the Facebook posts asking people to bring Dembner food. ""Food is my talent so whenever people need food, I'll cook,"" Thomas told CNN. She learned that Dembner loves soul food, so she says she'll back to his house Friday to drop off collard greens. Dembner used to have nurses who came to the house, but Mulvihill says due to the conditions they had to stop coming. Now, Mulvihill has set up appointments for nurses and health care support to start coming to the home again. She told CNN she contacted organizations like adult services, Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army and the local police, but none were able to help. Mulvihill says Mr. Ronald has been overwhelmed by the support. ""He is so thankful, he cracks me up. He keeps saying, 'I don't know what I did to deserve all of this from all you guys,'"" said Mulvihill. ""It's giving him hope that he will be taken care of.""",health,CNN,left
"Mother arrested after allegedly leaving baby in hot, locked car to enter store","A woman is facing a possible charge of child endangerment in Oklahoma, after police say she left her 14-month-old child in a car for 15 to 20 minutes so that she could go into a liquor store. Police in Owasso said officers were called to the Owasso Wine and Liquor a little after 6:30 p.m. Wednesday after they received a call about a child locked inside a vehicle . There was no key in the ignition and the air ""was turned on low, however no air was moving,"" the police report said. The front windows were also rolled down 1 to 2 inches, officers said. The child was described as having "" red clammy skin tone , sweating and crying hysterically,"" the report said. When officers arrived to the store's parking lot , a bystander could be heard telling them on body-cam footage that she'd initially seen the child lying down in the car. ""I can hear him but I can't see him anymore,"" she told the officer as he peered into the locked vehicle and attempted to open the doors . A few moments later, two women including the child's mother   identified by police as Gretchen Anne Markovics, 24, of Owasso, Oklahoma   could be seen on body-cam footage leaving the store. ""Is this your car?"" one officer asks the unidentified woman. ""Yes, sir,"" the woman can be heard saying off camera. ""Open it up right now,"" the officer says as a child can be heard crying from inside the car. After the woman unlocks the car and opens the driver's side door, the officer puts her under arrest. ""The hell were you thinking?"" he asks her. Another officer could then be seen on body-cam footage removing the crying child, wearing only a diaper, from the car as medics were called to the scene. Markovics then appeared on the other side of the vehicle. ""I thought the A.C. was on,"" Markovics tells officers. ""The car isn't even running,"" the officer tells her as he arrests her. The temperature outside was 88 degrees, police said in their report, but it had a real feel of 91 degrees with 59% humidity. The car was parked in direct sunlight with no shade, police said. ""Whenever the baby starts sweating, that means the baby is overheated and that can quickly lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion and so on, so we are lucky this child made it out OK,"" Owasso police Lt. Nick Boatman told ABC News affiliate KTUL-TV . The child was treated by medics and then taken to a hospital as a precaution, police said. Markovics was transported to Tulsa County Jail and being held on $25,000 bond. It was unclear if she had a lawyer, according to the jail. Her next court date was scheduled for July 5.",crime,ABC News,left
CNN's Anderson Cooper remembers mom Gloria Vanderbilt as visitor from 'distant star',"(Reuters) - CNN anchor Anderson Cooper remembered his mother, designer and society grand dame Gloria Vanderbilt, as a woman who endured a string of heartbreaks but still remained deeply in love with love. ""I always felt it was my job to protect her. She was the strongest person I ever met but she wasn't tough,"" Cooper said in a seven-minute video https://youtu.be/cfbRneB9wcA obituary on CNN. ""I always thought of her as a visitor from another world, a traveler stranded here who had come from a distant star that had burned out long ago."" Vanderbilt, who died on Monday at age 95, had been famous her entire life, starting with a legal battle in which her aunt took custody from her mother when ""Little Gloria"" was a child. She would go on to endure four marriages, three divorces, the death of a husband and the suicide of a son. Cooper's obituary featured clips of young Gloria and told how she grew up in France, unaware that she was heir to the Vanderbilt railroad fortune. Portions also were taken from an HBO documentary ""Nothing Left Unsaid: Gloria Vanderbilt & Anderson Cooper."" When Cooper questioned why she first married a 32-year-old Hollywood figure, Vanderbilt told him, ""Sweetheart, I was only 17."" His mother ""trusted too freely, too completely"" but always pressed on, Cooper said, and always believed that the next true love was just around the corner. ""She was always in love - in love with men or with friends or books and art, in love with her children and her grandchildren and then her great-grandchildren,"" Cooper said. ""Love is what she believed in more than anything."" Cooper said his mother learned earlier this month that she had advanced and spreading stomach cancer. Her response was to cite a 1950 hit song by Peggy Lee with the lyrics ""show me the way to get out of this world because that's where everything is."" The CNN report included a video Cooper shot in a hospital after the diagnosis as he and his mother broke into laughing fits over a joke. Cooper said that was when he realized they had the same giggle. He said he still giggles every time he watches that video. (This story refiles to add dropped word ""a"" in second paragraph.)

"ron desantis signs amendment 4 bill, limiting felon voting","TALLAHASSEE   Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law Friday evening a controversial bill limiting how many felons will be able to vote, undercutting much of the promise of last year's historic Amendment 4. DeSantis announced the signing in a news release after the close of business before a weekend   one day short of his deadline to sign it. ""I am considering whether to seek restoration of all civil rights to some of those whose rights were restored by Amendment 4,"" DeSantis wrote in a letter to Florida's Secretary of State Laurel Lee. ""However, I would only consider restoring rights to those convicted of non-violent offenses."" DeSantis, however, did not address the most controversial part of the Legislature's bill. The bill passed last month by Florida's Republican-controlled Legislature was called a ""poll tax"" by critics because it requires all felons to pay back their financial obligations before being eligible to vote. Those obligations are expected to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of felons who can't immediately afford to pay off their court fees, fines and restitution to victims. The bill was a blow to supporters of last year's Amendment 4, which was supposed to wipe out one of the most racist and enduring policies of Florida's Jim Crow era. Nearly two-thirds of voters last year approved the historic amendment. The 150-year-old law preventing felons from voting was created in the wake of the Civil War, and it was meant to keep black people off the voter rolls. VOTING RIGHTS: Florida Legislature approves Amendment 4 bill that creates hurdles for voting felons Amendment 4 will likely cost 'millions' to carry out. Here's why. She owes $59 million. Should she be allowed to vote under Amendment 4? It worked. By 2016, more than one in five black Floridians were ineligible to vote because they were felons. And the process for getting the right to vote back was arduous, requiring, under Gov. Rick Scott, felons to drive to Tallahassee and plead their case before the governor and Cabinet. The amendment voters passed allowed felons to automatically be eligible to vote if they completed ""all terms of their sentence including parole or probation."" Supporters of the amendment argued that the language was simple enough, and that the Legislature didn't need to clarify it further. But county elections supervisors asked lawmakers for guidance interpreting the amendment. For supporters of Amendment 4, the language meant that felons who left prison and completed parole and probation could automatically vote. That would also have been the simplest way to carry it out, too, since the Florida Department of Corrections tracks felons who are still under supervision. But Republican lawmakers took a more restrictive approach. They argued that ""all terms of sentence"" included the various court fines, fees and restitution to victims that felons often have to pay, and that felons would have to repay all of those debts before being able to vote. While some other states have similar policies, it means that some felons will have to wait years to vote, if they can ever vote at all. One woman told lawmakers during the Legislative session that she owes $59 million in restitution, which she'll never be able to repay. And the Republicans' approach is confusing and expensive. Because no state or local agency tracks restitution, lawmakers estimated it would cost ""millions"" to carry out. It goes into effect Monday.     ©2019 the Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.)

U.S. 'gag rule' linked to 40% jump in abortions in parts of Africa,"LONDON (Reuters) - A decades-old U.S. government policy reinstated by President Donald Trump in 2017 that restricts international aid to NGOs that support abortion is linked to a 40% rise in abortions in some parts of sub-Saharan African, a study showed on Thursday. The ""Mexico City Policy"", also known as the ""global gag rule"", also led to more pregnancies and lower contraceptive use among women in African countries reliant on U.S. foreign aid, the study in the Lancet Global Health journal showed. The policy prevents U.S. federal funding from being used overseas to support any organisation that performs or provides counselling on abortion. Successive U.S. administrations have flip-flopped between rescinding and reinstating it along partisan lines since it was created by the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan in 1984. ""Our findings suggest how a U.S. policy that aims to restrict federal funding for abortion services can lead, unintentionally, to more   and probably riskier   abortions in poor countries,"" said Nina Brooks, a researcher at Stanford University who co-led the work. The researchers urged the United States, as the world's biggest donor of development assistance, to recognise the health of mothers as ""a global priority"", and warned that the Mexico City Policy's knock-on effects could add to maternal death rates. The study looked at induced abortion, contraception use and pregnancy rates between 1995 and 2014. It used data from 26 sub-Saharan African countries over two U.S. policy transitions - from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, then from Bush to Barack Obama - and compared rates in countries exposed to a greater or lesser extent to the policy due to reliance on aid. The researchers used what they called a ""difference-in-difference"" method to identify any changes - in other words they analysed whether the difference between rates or abortion, pregnancy and contraceptive use in high-exposure countries versus low-exposure countries were significantly greater when the policy was in place than when it was not. Results showed a significant 40% increase in abortion rates in exposed countries when the policy was active, as well as a 13.5% relative drop in the use of modern contraceptives, and a 12% rise in rates of pregnancy. Stanford University's Eran Bendavid, who co-led the study, said its findings had probably captured only a partial view of the policy's harm to maternal health, since knock-on effects of risky abortions were not measured. ""Because abortions are an important cause of maternal mortality, the increase in abortion uptake might also increase maternal deaths   and possibly disproportionately given that abortions under the policy could be less safe,"" he said.

U.S. court urged to throw out 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli's conviction,"NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - A lawyer for former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli on Friday urged a federal appeals court to overturn Shkreli's criminal conviction for defrauding investors in hedge funds he founded. The lawyer, Mark Baker, argued that the jury that convicted Shkreli was given incorrect instructions about securities fraud. Baker faced a barrage of skeptical questions from a three-judge panel during a brief proceeding in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Shkreli, 36, gained notoriety as the ""Pharma Bro"" after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent, to $750 per pill in 2015. He was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy in December 2015, convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in August 2017 and sentenced to seven years in prison last year. He was also ordered to forfeit more than $7 million. His criminal case stemmed from two hedge funds and a drug company he had founded years before Turing. The jury found that he defrauded investors in the funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses, and schemed to prop up the stock price of the drug company, Retrophin Inc. The jury acquitted him of related wire fraud conspiracy charges, for which it received slightly different instructions. Baker argued on Friday that the split verdict showed the instructions had made the difference. ""The split verdict in this case speaks volumes as to the care the jury took,"" he said. Circuit Judge Joseph Bianco, however, said the jury instructions appeared necessary after Shkreli's lawyer at trial suggested that Shkreli could not be guilty because he eventually paid his investors back. Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston pressed Baker on that point: ""A belief that ultimately no one will be harmed is not a defense to a securities fraud case, correct?"" Baker conceded that it was not. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith, arguing for the prosecution, said the different instructions for securities fraud and wire fraud reflected a difference in the laws on those crimes. In a brief rebuttal, Baker said that even if Shkreli's conviction stands, the fact that he eventually paid back investors should ""wipe out"" his obligation to forfeit cash. The Brooklyn-born Shkreli, the son of Albanian immigrants, is scheduled to be released from prison in October 2023 if he fails to get his conviction tossed out.

Judge stops government lawyers quitting census question case,"NEW YORK (AP)   The Justice Department can't replace nine lawyers so late in the dispute over whether to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census without explaining why it's doing so, a judge says. U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, who earlier this year ruled against adding the citizenship question, put the brakes on the government's plan on Tuesday, a day after he was given a three-paragraph notification by the Justice Department along with a prediction that the replacement of lawyers wouldn't ""cause any disruption in this matter."" ""Defendants provide no reasons, let alone 'satisfactory reasons,' for the substitution of counsel,"" Furman wrote, noting that the most immediate deadline for government lawyers to submit written arguments in the case is only three days away. The judge said local rules for federal courts in New York City require that any attorney requesting to leave a case provide satisfactory reasons for withdrawing. The judge must then decide what impact a lawyer's withdrawal will have on the timing of court proceedings. He called the Justice Department's request ""patently deficient,"" except for two lawyers who have left the department or the civil division that is handling the case. President Donald Trump tweeted about the judge's decision Tuesday night, questioning whether the attorney change denial was unprecedented. ""So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won't let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?"" Trump tweeted. The new team came about after a top Justice Department civil attorney who was leading the litigation effort told Attorney General William Barr that multiple people on the team preferred not to continue, Barr told The Associated Press on Monday. The attorney who was leading the team, James Burnham, ""indicated it was a logical breaking point since a new decision would be made and the issue going forward would hopefully be separate from the historical debates,"" Barr said. Furman's refusal came in a case that has proceeded on an unusual legal path since numerous states and municipalities across the country challenged the government's announcement early last year that it intended to add the citizenship question to the census for the first time since 1950. Opponents of the question say it will depress participation by immigrants, lowering the population count in states that tend to vote Democratic and decreasing government funds to those areas because funding levels are based on population counts. The Justice Department succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to block plans to depose Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Nearly two weeks ago, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the plans to add the census question, saying the administration's justification for adding the question ""seems to have been contrived."" Afterward, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau began printing census questionnaires without the question and the Department of Justice signaled it would not attempt to continue the legal fight. It reversed itself after Trump promised to keep trying to add the question. The Justice Department then notified judges in three similar legal challenges that it planned to find a new legal path to adding the question to the census. Furman said the urgency to resolve legal claims and the need for efficient judicial proceedings was an important consideration in rejecting a replacement of lawyers. He said the Justice Department had insisted that the speedy resolution of lawsuits against adding the question was ""a matter of great private and public importance."" ""If anything, that urgency   and the need for efficient judicial proceedings   has only grown since that time,"" Furman said. Furman said the government could re-submit its request to replace attorneys only with a sworn statement by each lawyer explaining satisfactory reasons to withdraw so late. He said he'll require new attorneys to promise personnel changes will not slow the case. ___ Associated Press Writer Mike Balsamo in Washington contributed to this report.",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
"A Florida city was forced to use pen and paper and pay a $500,000 ransom after hackers took control of its computers","A Florida city was hit by a ransomware attack that forced the city to use pen and paper instead of its computer systems to conduct its work. Lake City, Florida, paid the hackers the ransom that's estimated at around $500,000. The ransom was paid in Bitcoin , so the exact amount is dependent on the price of Bitcoin at any given time. It's unclear if the city's main network was protected by sufficient layers of security. Several US cities have recently been hit by ransomware attacks, highlighting how US cities are poorly prepared against cyberattacks . Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The Lake City, Florida, administration agreed on Monday to pay hackers almost $500,000 to release the city's computer files in a ransomware attack that occurred on June 10, local media reported . Before it decided to pay the ransom, the city had to use its back-up systems to conduct its work, which included paper receipts and hand-written building permits. ""Utility payments can still be made in-person at City Hall, however credit card payments are currently not available,"" the city said in a press release on June 10, when the city said it was hit by the ransomware attack. ""While other City networks are currently disabled, Public Safety networks are isolated and protected by encryption,"" the city said in its press release. It's somewhat reassuring that Lake City's public safety networks are encrypted, but it suggests that the city's main governmental network was not protected, or it didn't have the same layers of protection as its public safety network. The burning question is why the city's main network was not protected by the same layers of security as its public safety network. A spokesperson for Lake City spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Read more : A massive, ongoing hack has been compromising cell service providers around the world without them even knowing, a new report says The cyberattack on Lake City is the second in Florida in just a few weeks, which further highlights how unprepared US cities are in dealing with cyberattacks. Just last week, the city of Riviera Beach, also in Florida, was hit by a similar cyberattack . The city also paid a ransom to the hackers to the tune of $600,000. Both ransoms were paid in Bitcoin. In March, the city of Atlanta, Georgia, was also hit by a ransomware attack that forced the city to shut down municipal courts and prevented residents from paying certain bills online. Cyber security research firm Recorded Future published a review of ransomware attacks of state and local governments, where three US cities were affected by cyberattacks since April, including Lynn, Massachusetts; Cartersville, Georgia; and Baltimore, Maryland. The report said that Baltimore had been hit at least twice with ransomware attacks. Recorded Future said in its report that ransomware attacks against state and local governments are ""not going away anytime soon.""",crime,Business Insider,center
San Bruno Police Step Up Crackdown on Illegal Fireworks,"SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX)   All across the Bay Area there are communities that promise a ""zero tolerance"" policy on illegal fireworks. In San Bruno, it seems, they really mean it. ""Everyone in the entire department is required to work the Fourth of July in San Bruno,"" says Lieutenant Ryan Johansen of the San Bruno police department. The entire staff is working Thursday and, if it's anything like last year, they will be busy. The department made 25 arrests and seized 400 pounds of illegal fireworks on July 4, 2018. Three hundred pounds of that came from just one vehicle. The issue of fireworks   even the legal ones   is something this community has wrestled with over the years. ""There's a large contingency that really advocates every year to keep fireworks legal in San Bruno as a matter of tradition and practice,"" said Lt. Johansen. ""And then there's the other group that says this is a huge nuisance, a problem for pets, a problem for safety and that they want to stop. So somewhere in between is to continue to allow them and try to enforce the illegal stuff as best we can."" Residents can buy legal fireworks from the San Bruno Police Officers Association but police also have a hotline for reporting illegal fireworks and even use unmarked surveillance vehicles to catch violators. ""We will put out surveillance teams whose sole purpose is to observe the fireworks being used because they're a little bit tougher to detect,"" Johansen said. ""And they'll send in marked units in uniforms to actually issue citations."" So, with all of the arrests and citations handed out last year, do police think people will be any more inclined to celebrate by the rules this year? ""You know, I would love to say 'yes,'"" Johansen laughed. ""Unfortunately, I think it's just the people who received the thousand-dollar citations last year that are probably more likely to be safe this year and those who didn't get caught will wait until they do.""",crime,KPIX,left
New video shows Jussie Smollett with rope around his neck moments after alleged attack,"The Chicago Police Department released video of actor Jussie Smollett in the moments after he reported an alleged attack against him in January.

""They poured bleach on me,"" Smollett said in one of the videos as he began to undo the rope from his neck. ""They poured bleach on me."" In a 911 call also released by police on Monday, a man told the operator that he works with an ""artist"" who was attacked and he wanted to file a report. ""What's really weird ma'am, just because I'm scared and I don't know what it is, they put a noose around his neck,"" the unidentified caller said. Smollett was accused of falsely reporting what police say was a staged attack. He was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for the alleged false report in March, charges that were later dropped against him . The actor has maintained his innocence and insists he was attacked. Police say that the actor's personal trainers, Abimbola ""Abel"" Osundairo and Olabinjo ""Ola"" Osundairo, admitted to helping him stage the January incident. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson had previously said Smollett invented the hate crime and took ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career."" A judge ruled Friday that a special prosecutor needs to investigate Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx's handling of the Smollett case and that the ""Empire"" actor should be re-examined for possible criminal charges. ""The unprecedented irregularities identified in this case warrants the appointment of independent counsel to restore the public's confidence in the integrity of our criminal justice system,"" Cook County Circuit Court Judge Michael Toomin wrote. Foxx recused herself in February from a possible prosecution of Smollett, saying at the time it was due to conflicts of interest from having contacted the actor's family. She has since changed her explanation, saying in June the recusal was due to rumors she was related to Smollett, rumors she says were racist . Toomin said Foxx was right to take herself out of the case, but then wrong to place another prosecutor from her office in charge of it. She appointed First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats to oversee the matter, when she should have sought an outside prosecutor, according to Toomin. ""Yet for reasons undisclosed even to this day, Foxx instead chose to detour from the mandated course, instead appointing Mr. Magats as `the acting State's Attorney for this mater,'"" Toomin wrote. Toomin excoriated Foxx for creating ""an entity that did not exist."" Gloria Schmidt, a lawyer for the Osundairo brothers, said they're willing to answer any questions from a special prosecutor. ""The special prosecutor would have an opportunity to look at the evidence and effectively do this whole case over again   re-charge him, re-arraign him, reconvene the grand jury,"" Schmidt said. ""It's like we're back to square one.""",legal arguments,NBC News,left
Man arrested in connection with death of soccer player Sala,"LONDON (AP)   Police investigating the death of Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala arrested a man on Wednesday on suspicion of manslaughter. A single-engine aircraft carrying Sala and pilot David Ibbotson crashed in the English Channel on Jan. 21. The body of Sala, who had just signed for Cardiff City from French club Nantes and was traveling to join his new team in Wales, was recovered from the wreckage two weeks later. Detectives in the southwest English county of Dorset, where Sala's body was brought in February, have been investigating the circumstances of the player's death and said a 64-year-old man was arrested ""on suspicion of manslaughter by an unlawful act."" ""He is assisting with our inquiries and has been released from custody under investigation,"" Detective Inspector Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police, said. Police said the man was from North Yorkshire in England. Family liaison officers have been updating the families of Sala and Ibbotson, the pilot of the plane that lost contact with Air Traffic Control north of Guernsey. The body of Ibbotson, who was 59 at the time of the crash, has not been found. Cardiff, which was playing in the English Premier League up until May, agreed to pay a club-record fee of 15 million pounds (about $20 million) to Nantes to sign Sala. Mark McKay, one of the brokers of the transfer, said he helped to organize a ""private flight"" for Sala to Wales from Nantes, where he had returned briefly after signing the deal in Cardiff. Nantes and Cardiff are still in a dispute over Sala's transfer fee, which was a record signing. Another English police force in Wiltshire, west of London, said this month that two people were facing charges over a photograph showing Sala's body at a mortuary. They will appear in court next month. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",crime,AP,center
"25 Dallas Police Officers Under Investigation for Allegedly Posting Racist, Threatening Content on Facebook","Four active-duty Dallas police officers have been placed on administrative leave and 21 others were under internal investigation after the officers were believed to have made racist and violent comments on their Facebook profiles. The move by the Dallas Police Department came one month after a cache of social media posts from police officers in eight U.S. jurisdictions was made public by The Plain View Project, which had scoured the Facebook profiles of law enforcement officers nationwide over the past two years to compile a database of potentially inflammatory or otherwise objectionable content. After the database was first made public, the Dallas Police Department released a statement saying that it was ""thoroughly investigating the names and posts"" of officers flagged by the database. ""We take these matters seriously and we want to assure the community that we will not tolerate racism, bigotry or hatred of any kind in our organization,"" the statement concluded. The Plain View Project has now collected around 5,000 posts, around 300 of which were allegedly published by active-duty Dallas officers. Friday's announcement from the Dallas Police Department explained that the ""department's preliminary findings show that 25 officers posted or shared material that was determined to be a potential violation of DPD's General Orders and/or Code of Conduct."" ""Four of those officers have been placed on administrative leave based on the extreme nature of their posts,"" the police said. The 25 officers currently under scrutiny from the department were a subset of the 170 current and former Dallas officers whose posts were deemed offensive enough for The Plain View Project to flag. The Facebook posts contained language that, among other things, disparaged racial minorities and made light of police brutality. One allegedly current Dallas Police officer shared a meme that contained the phrase: ""Despite what you've been told, violence does solve problems."" Another purportedly active-duty officer shared a meme from a Blue Lives Matter Facebook page that encouraged people to watch a video of protesters getting hit by a car. ""WATCH: Car vs. Protesters. Car always wins,"" the post read, followed by several laughing emojis. One post shared by someone believed to be a current officer included an image of a figure labeled ""Europe"" watering a sapling labeled ""Islam,"" which was tied to a noose strung around the figure's neck, implying that as the tree grew, ""Europe"" would be hanged. Other posts directly advocated for police violence and, in some cases, committing murder. ""We take these matters seriously and we want to ensure the community that we will not tolerate racism, bigotry or hatred of any kind in our organization,"" Dallas Police Chief U. Reneé Hall said on Friday. ""The Dallas Police Department prides itself on maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity while providing service to the community without prejudice.""

Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 reportedly launching on August 7th,"Google might be content to just tweet out photos of its upcoming phones , but Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 looks to be following a more traditional script. The latest: Shara Tibken at CNET is reporting that ""people familiar"" say it will launch on August 7th in New York City. The first week of August certainly is the right timeframe for a Note launch. The Note is traditionally Samsung's premier platform for showing off new phone technology (setting aside the Galaxy Fold for a moment, anyway). This year, rumors point to the company creating two different sizes , one of which will be 5G , and neither of which will have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Most recently , we have the above-pictured, leaked render from @Onleaks and Pricebaba which shows Samsung getting closer to eliminating the top and bottom bezels altogether. It also moves Samsung's hole punch selfie camera to the middle, instead of off to the side as it is on the Galaxy S10. Rumors point to the larger Note having a massive 6.75-inch screen while the smaller should be 6.3 inches diagonally. It appears there will be three cameras on the back, aligned vertically instead of horizontally. Related Slideshow: Provided by Photo Services CNET says that Samsung will once again use the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to host attendees, and that the Unpacked event will be ""flashy."" Neither of those details are a surprise   though here's the part where we stop setting aside the Galaxy Fold and just ask: what the heck is going on with Samsung's foldable phone? Will Samsung announce a new release date? Will it cancel it altogether? Current rumors suggest it won't ship until after the Note 10. Samsung certainly needs to do or say something before (or maybe even during) this ""flashy"" Note 10 unveiling. Otherwise the Fold will hang over the whole event like a cloud. One thing is for sure: expect more leaks in the run-up to the Note 10's official announcement. The stakes are higher than usual, too, because Samsung needs to show that it can handily fill up the space that's suddenly been made by the bans on Huawei's phones . The Note 10 will be big   will it be big enough?",science,CNET,center
judge temporarily throws out wayne state lawsuit,"A state Court of Claims judge has temporarily thrown out a lawsuit between Wayne State University board members over a technicality on how it was filed. However, Judge Cythnia Stephens said at the close of a Friday morning hearing that once the suit was refiled, she would take into consideration the arguments made during the hearing and issue a written ruling within 10 days. The four Wayne State board members who sued their four fellow board members said they would refile as soon as possible. Attorneys for both sides spent the morning expanding on what they've already said in written briefs. Board members who are being sued cast those suing as sore losers. The case ""should be settled in the board room, not the court room. The plaintiffs' political gamble did not work in the board room ... and should not be rewarded,"" Todd Mendel, attorney for four board members being sued, told the court. Board member Marilyn Kelly reiterated that following the ruling. ""We have a minority of board members"" who are upset with this decision and other issues, she said. ""They want your (the media) attention."" Not true, said Michael Busuito, one of the board members on the other side, pointing out boycotts are a commonly used means of protest. ""Sometimes it's the only thing you can do,"" he said. ""In the past three years, Wayne State has become less transparent and engaged in more bullying. We are trying to do our roles representing the public and stop that."" The suit centers on an allegation that a meeting held at the end of the June was illegal and that all decisions made in the meeting, including renting property for a physicians group tied to the medical school and a tuition increase, should be invalidated. The suit alleges the board didn't have a quorum to meet. The board members being sued argue they did, because they counted Wayne State President Roy Wilson, an ex-officio member of the board who can't vote, in its quorum count. The suit also alleges the board violated the state's Open Meetings Act. On Friday morning, attorneys for both sides spent considerable time arguing about the Open Meetings Act. Those being sued say established state law and rulings from courts say the board can meet behind closed doors and make decisions. More: Half of Wayne State University board sues other half More: Wayne State: We don't have to meet in public, so suit against us should be tossed More: DMC, Wayne State fight for years with millions of dollars and care of poor at stake A the late June board meeting, half the board didn't show up in an attempt to stop the lease for a new pediatrician's physicians group. The other half of the board had a legal opinion saying Wilson should be counted when trying to get to a quorum. Those who were at the board meeting   and are being sued   are Bryan Barnhill, Kim Trent, Mark Gaffney and Marilyn Kelly. The four board members who weren't there and are suing are Michael Busuito, Sandra Hughes O'Brien, Anil Kumar and Dana Thompson. Their filing also claims there is no harm created by the meeting, and the suit is unfounded. In contrast, those suing say there is no method available to correct the moves made in the meeting other that having the judge step in. Contact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

"Sacramento County's safety net is failing Medi-Cal and uninsured patients, report says","Sacramento County has ""historically lagged"" in providing health care services for its Medi-Cal recipients and its poor and uninsured populations, according to a new report by California Health Access. Released this week, the report by the patient advocacy group found that Sacramento County struggles or fails to provide basic safety net services that other counties in the state provide   there is no public hospital, fewer primary care doctors take on new Medi-Cal patients, and navigating available health care plans is complex and confusing. Sacramento County ""certainly isn't the worst"" county in California when it comes to providing health care services to the poor and uninsured, said Health Access California executive director Anthony Wright ""But it is certainly is not the best, and for a sort of large sophisticated county like Sacramento, you'd expect it to have a more robust set of infrastructure and services,"" he said. More than 428,000 Sacramento County residents have Medi-Cal insurance as of last month , according to the California Health and Human Services agency. ""Residents with Medi-Cal coverage in Sacramento struggle to find a provider or access specialty care while the uninsured are left with even fewer options for both primary and specialty care,"" the report read. ""The question the county now must ask is how Sacramento can go from laggard to leader in caring for its vulnerable populations."" Key recommendations for the county in the report include: Defending the safety net against federal repeals and rollbacks Boosting programs for uninsured and medically indigent residents Increasing oversight of and transitioning out of the Geographic Managed Care model   a model that allows Medi-Cal recipients to pick among many different health plans, which in turn contract clinics, hospitals and other providers Encouraging UC Davis and other hospital chains such as Sutter and Dignity to contract more with Medi-Cal plans In 2015, people on Medi-Cal could no longer get primary care services such as checkups and consultations at UC Davis Medical Center without paying out of pocket. The hospital had historically operated as a county hospital. That led to more emergency room visits by Medi-Cal patients, and increased pressure on community clinics as a stopgap. Though UC Davis briefly began accepting one Medi-Cal coverage plan for primary care services in 2017, that access threatened to end again last year . The new contract with HealthNet   which serves only about a quarter of all Medi-Cal recepients in Sacramento County   was secured last October. In this environment, with the Affordable Care Act providing more resources, community and student-run clinics have flourished, Wright said. But they can't always provide specialty care like larger hospital, and they aren't sufficient to cover the county's growing need, he said. ""There is a downtown clinic, but if you're in the further outskirts, your access may be threadbare or nonexistent,"" Wright said. As for transitioning out of the Geographic Managed Care, or GMC, model, Wright said Sacramento County should look to other systems more widely used in the state. While the GMC model may seem like a better option because it allows patients to have more health care plan options, Wright said the system ends up ""carving up"" existing medical resources like hospitals, clinics and doctors, and ultimately limiting access. And because patients are directly signing up for plans through nonprofits and private groups, rather than through the county, there is less accountability, he said. ""One of the issues here is, is there a greater role for Sacramento-focused consumers and stakeholders to be involved in?"" Wright said.     ©2019 The Sacramento Bee (Sacramento, Calif.)

"Boston train derails near Fenway Park before Red Sox game, sending 10 to hospital","BOSTON   Ten people were injured Saturday when a subway train derailed inside a tunnel near Fenway Park prior to the first game of a doubleheader between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays. The derailment occurred at approximately 10:55 a.m. between the Fenway and Kenmore stops on the green line of the Boston train and subway system known as ""The T."" Some people were carried out of the tunnel by stoke baskets, according to the Boston Fire Department, and 10 were transported to local hospitals. The Boston Globe quoted a passenger, 19-year-old Bryan Marden, who said the train was traveling at a high rate of speed before it derailed where the subway split. He said some of the passengers who were hurt appeared to be headed to the Red Sox game and nearby Pride Parade festivities. First pitch of the Red Sox game was 1:05 p.m. Joe Pesaturo, spokesman for MBTA, said the injuries are ""not life threatening."" Boston Emergency Medical Services described the injuries as ""varying in nature."" The Globe reported that some appeared to be serious.

Hubble Space Telescope spots 'soccer balls' in space,"The Hubble Space Telescope has identified soccer ball-shaped molecules amid the gas and dust that fills the space beyond our solar system and between other star systems. That space is known as the interstellar medium or ISM, and Hubble is exposing some of the mysterious electrically charged molecules within it. A recently published study in the Astrophysical Journal Letters explores the soccer ball molecules. When stars and planets form, they pull together material from clouds of gas and dust. This is why the interstellar medium is so important. ""The diffuse ISM can be considered as the starting point for the chemical processes that ultimately give rise to planets and life,"" said Martin Cordiner, study author and research associate in the Catholic University of America's Department of Physics, in a statement. ""So fully identifying its contents provides information on the ingredients available to create stars and planets."" Cordiner is now at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the agency said Tuesday. The soccer ball shape of the molecule is due to the arrangement of 60 carbon atoms in a hollow sphere, giving them the shorthand of C60. The molecules are a form of carbon called Buckminsterfullerene or Buckyballs. On Earth, these molecules can rarely be found in rocks and minerals or appear in soot created from high combustion. Although the molecules have been observed in space before, this observation marks the first time that electrically charged C60 has been seen in the interstellar medium. The electrical charge occurs when an electron is shorn off by UV light from stars, which creates a positive charge. ""The diffuse ISM was historically considered too harsh and tenuous an environment for appreciable abundances of large molecules to occur,"" Cordiner said. ""Prior to the detection of C60, the largest known molecules in space were only 12 atoms in size. Our confirmation of C60+ shows just how complex astrochemistry can get, even in the lowest density, most strongly ultraviolet-irradiated environments in the Galaxy."" The interstellar medium is difficult to study because it's so far away, so astronomers have to study the way it affects light from distant stars to understand it. Some of the compounds that make up the interstellar medium block or absorb different wavelengths of starlight as it passes through this space. Those compounds have unique patterns that affect starlight, allowing astronomers to identify them as diffuse interstellar bands. Testing the many bands to match them up would take quite some time, but the research team was able to match C60. Hubble observations were matched with C60 data. This detection could help astronomers understand other compounds. Although most of this interstellar environment contains helium and hydrogen, two of the most plentiful elements in the universe, there are other unidentified compounds waiting to be discovered. Life as we know it is carbon-based, and now carbon has been shown to form and survive in the harsh and exposed interstellar medium. ""In some ways, life can be thought of as the ultimate in chemical complexity,"" Cordiner said. ""The presence of C60 unequivocally demonstrates a high level of chemical complexity intrinsic to space environments, and points toward a strong likelihood for other extremely complex, carbon-bearing molecules arising spontaneously in space."" Cordiner said that the researchers will continue searching to see where else they can locate the molecules in the universe. At the moment, their observations seem to point to a widespread presence in our galaxy, the Milky Way.",science,CNN,left
george conway urges trump to resign over aborted iran strike,"George Conway blasted President Trump and called for him to resign from office after he walked back a planned military strike against Iran in response to the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone.

""We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone,"" Trump tweeted. Iranian officials said Friday that Trump warned them that an attack was imminent. The officials also said Friday that they were informed of the planned attack in a ""short period"" before it was initially scheduled to be carried out. ""In his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Tehran about various issues,"" one Iranian official said. U.S. and Iranian officials are disputing the location of the drone when it was shot down late Wednesday, with Iran arguing that it had entered the country's airspace. The U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said the U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk drone was shot down by an Iranian missile system in an ""unprovoked attack."" Centcom denied claims from Iranian officials stating that the drone had flown over Hormozgan Province in southern Iran. ""This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and free flow of commerce, "" Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, said in a statement. The New York Times reported late Thursday that Trump had ordered a strike overnight against Iran, but pulled back. Following that report, Conway railed against Trump in a late-night tweet that he has since pinned to his Twitter page , slamming the commander in chief as an ""erratic, unstable, incompetent, ignorant, intellectually lazy, narcissistic, and sociopathic man whose judgment no serious, intelligent person trusts.""",science,The Boston Globe,left
"260 guests are taken ill with 'food poisoning' at 90th birthday party for Imelda Marcos after 2,500 people gathered to honour widow of former Philippines dictator","Video by Reuters More than 200 guests fell ill with suspected food poisoning on Wednesday after a meal at a birthday party for 90-year-old Imelda Marcos, the notorious ex-first lady of the Philippines. Ambulances rushed vomiting friends and supporters from a sports stadium in Manila where around 2,500 people gathered to honour the widow of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Although Marcos was chased from power by a 1986 peaceful uprising, the family is still revered by many in the Philippines and has made a political comeback in recent years. 'Our ambulances took people to hospital after they complained of dizziness and vomiting. They apparently suffered from food poisoning,' Philippine Red Cross chairman Richard Gordon said. Health secretary Francisco Duque told journalists the number of ill was 260. The party featured singing and speeches, as well as water bottles adorned with Imelda's name and meals in plastic boxes. There were no immediate reports that the guest of honour was taken ill. Family matriarch Imelda was convicted in November in a corruption case stemming from the time of her husband's brutal dictatorship. Although currently free on bail pending an appeal, she faces decades behind bars after being found guilty of funnelling around $200 million through Swiss foundations decades ago. Ferdinand Marcos, who along with his cronies was accused of pilfering $10 billion from the Philippines, fled with his family to the US after his dictatorship fell in 1986. He died in exile in 1989, but his heirs later returned to Manila and have staged a something of a political comeback. Imelda Marcos just finished a term as a congresswoman, her son Ferdinand Junior has also served as a senator while eldest daughter Imee won a Senate seat in May's elections. The family has a powerful ally in President Rodrigo Duterte, who ordered the late dictator's remains interred at Manila's Heroes' Cemetery despite public protests. Read more",health,Reuters,center
usc to pay $50 million and apologize to uc san diego for poaching its alzheimer's research program,"USC has agreed to pay UC San Diego $50 million and to publicly apologize to the school for the way it wrested control of its prestigious Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study in 2015 during a raid that led to a highly contentious lawsuit. The penalty and apology have resulted in the settlement of a lawsuit the UCSD and the UC Board of Regents brought against USC in San Diego County Superior Court. The move also represents an extraordinary turnaround from four years ago, when USC took control of the program's data and contracts worth tens of millions of dollars and gave jobs to the program's star researcher, Paul Aisen, and some of his staff. ""USC and Dr. Paul Aisen regret that the manner in which Dr. Aisen and members of the ADCS staff left UC San Diego and brought research assets to USC [and] created disruption to UC San Diego,"" the university said in a statement late Tuesday. ""These actions did not align with the standards of ethics and integrity which USC expects of all its faculty, administrators, and staff. USC is committed to, and wants to be known for, ethics, integrity and the pursuit of academic excellence, and it has already implemented sweeping changes to this end. ""These standards will apply to all aspects of University operations, including the recruitment and/or transition of faculty members to or from USC. USC regrets that actions in this case fell short of these standards."" Dr. David Brenner, UCSD's vice chancellor of health sciences, told the San Diego Union-Tribune, ""We're glad there's been a settlement. USC undermined our ability to do research. We have recovered under new leadership, we're better than ever, and we're working on trials. We're working to find ways to cure Alzheimer's disease."" The bitter dispute concerned not only the fate of UCSD's prized Alzheimer's research program, but the personal feelings of Aisen, who said UCSD had failed to give the program the resources it needed. Meanwhile, USC used the opportunity to extend the strength of its own Alzheimer's research, with Aisen's new center giving the university a major presence in San Diego. Aisen said Tuesday evening that he's glad the matter has been put to rest, so he can continue the important work of finding better treatments for Alzheimer's. ""I'm very happy to be moving forward,"" Aisen said. ""We have a lot of work to do. We have two major trials (of experimental Alzheimer's therapies)."" The dispute turned ugly when USC disclosed that it had gotten eight of the project's 10 main contracts after convincing sponsors that it was better suited to manage their clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies for the neurological disorder. Those sponsors defected from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, or ADCS, and shifted to an institute that USC opened in San Diego. At the time UCSD confirmed the major setback, but said USC overstated matters by claiming that the contract transfers were worth up to $93.5 million. Officials at UCSD conceded in 2015 that they failed to tightly manage the Alzheimer's program and allowed it to drift away from campus life. Brenner said on Tuesday night that the dispute was never about Aisen. ""We lose people all of the time,"" Brenner said. ""This was about how USC sabotaged our program.""

Construction on the McKinley sewage and water tank begins. Here's what to expect,"Construction has begun on a sewage and water vault beneath McKinley Park, Sacramento city officials announced Tuesday. Motorists should plan for road closures along 33rd Street from Park Way to McKinley Blvd during the tank's construction starting Monday, according to a news release from the city. Construction hours are 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The project to store 800,000 cubic feet of combined wastewater will be in the digging phase through the fall, and will included site prep and excavation, according to the project's website. Residents should expect trucks excavating dirt and soil from the area and hauling them to Sutter's Landing. The project is planned to be completed in 2021. A group of citizens filed a lawsuit in November in Sacramento Superior Court alleging that the project would harm historical aspects of the park, as well as create noise, vibration and air quality issues for the surrounding East Sacramento neighborhood. The 33-acre park was opened in 1872 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The lawsuit called for an injunction order to halt work until the case was resolved, but Judge Richard Sueyoshi denied that request , allowing the city to continue work on the project as planned, according to court documents. The $30 million project will install a large storage tank under the park that will store rain and sewage during major rainstorms to keep sewage from flowing into the streets. The water would be pumped after storms to the regional wastewater treatment plant near Elk Grove. The project also includes $1 million of enhancements to McKinley Park including new shade structures, new picnic tables and BBQ pit, replanting trees, new bathrooms and track enhancements, the website said.

Investigators recover helicopter that crashed in Bahamas,"HAVANA (AP)   Accident investigators in the Bahamas say they have recovered the helicopter that crashed after taking off from a remote private island on July 4, killing coal billionaire Chris Cline and six other Americans, as well as a British citizen. The Bahamas Air Accident Investigation Department said on its website that a Florida-based contractor pulled the Agusta AW139 helicopter from the ocean late Saturday night. The helicopter was expected to be taken to Fort Lauderdale and then to an accident investigation facility in Fort Pierce, Florida. Authorities have said it is too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the crash. They do not believe a distress call was made, and they only began searching after police received a report from Florida that the craft had failed to arrive in Fort Lauderdale as expected. Those killed included Cline's 22-year-old daughter, Kameron, and three of her close friends: Brittney Layne Searson, Jillian Clark, and Delaney Wykle. Searson, Clark and Kameron Cline were recent graduates of Louisiana State University. Wykle had recently graduated from West Virginia University. Brad Ullman, executive director of the West Virginia Golf Association, confirmed that David Jude also was killed in the crash. Bahamas Police Supt. Shanta Knowles said Saturday that Geoffrey Painter of Barnstaple in the United Kingdom also was killed, and she confirmed the other victims' identities to The Associated Press. Cline began toiling in the mines of southern West Virginia at a young age, rising through the ranks of his father's company quickly before forming his own energy development business, the Cline Group, which grew into one of the country's top coal producers. He went on to amass a fortune and became a major Republican donor. Paula Wykle, Delaney's mother, said her daughter had just passed her nursing boards and when one of the vacationing party got sick and needed to be transported back to the mainland, Delaney Wykle wanted to be there to help. ""She got to practice nursing for one day,"" Wykle said, calling her daughter ""smart, loving, and one of the best friends anyone could ever ask for."" The accident investigation department also said it was interviewing witnesses on Big Grand Cay, the island owned by Cline. The department has said the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Safety Board of Italy and the manufacturer of the aircraft and engine would all provide assistance with the investigation.",crime,AP,center
More than 20 reportedly killed in Papua New Guinea violence,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP)   More than 20 people including pregnant women and children have been killed in recent tribal violence in Papua New Guinea, media reported on Wednesday. The death toll and dates of the violence in the remote highland province of Hela varied in reports by Australian Broadcasting Corp. and the Post-Courier newspaper. Hela Gov. Philip Undialu told ABC the latest violence was on Monday when 16 people including women and children died at the village of Karida. The killings were probably retaliation for an earlier attack that left around seven dead, Undialu said. ""This has escalated into the massacre of innocent women and kids,"" Undialu said. The Post-Courier, based in the South Pacific island nation's capital Port Moresby, reported as many as 24 people were killed in the villages of Karida and Peta since Saturday. Six people had been ambushed and killed near Peta on Saturday, Hela Police Chief Inspector Teddy Augwi told the newspaper. The victims' relatives retaliated with rifles the next day, killing between 16 and 18 people at Karida, including pregnant women, he said. ""This is not a tribal fight where the opposing villagers face each other on field,"" Augwi told the newspaper. ""This is a fight in guerrilla warfare, meaning they play hide-and-seek and ambush their enemies."" Many villagers had fled the violence, Hela Administrator William Bando told the newspaper. It was not immediately clear if any suspects had been arrested. Papua New Guinea Police spokesman Superintendent Dominic Kakas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Tribal violence is common in Papua New Guinea's interior, where villagers avenge relatives in retaliation known as payback. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said those responsible for the fatal attacks could face the death penalty, ABC reported.

Drizzle and fog: Los Angeles wakes up to a gloomy start to the summer,"It may be the first day of summer, but Angelenos probably won't be breaking out their swimsuits anytime soon, as gray skies persist through the weekend. Friday morning brought light showers and cloudy skies to Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and the morning fog will likely continue through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. Meteorologist Rich Thompson said the June gloom is nothing out of the ordinary, even for the first day of summer. In the Los Angeles region, temperatures will warm up Saturday and Sunday afternoons, reaching between 70 and 85 degrees in the valleys. But in coastal areas, the clouds will stick around all weekend with temperatures hovering in the 60s. ""It's not the best beach weather this weekend,"" Thompson said. RELATED: What causes dreary, gray June gloom? » The cool weather has Southern California residents holding their breath, as fire season ramps up. Some areas have already seen conditions that would make any blazes that begin spread rapidly. Meteorologists on Friday warned of winds in the Antelope Valley that could reach 20 to 35 mph, with gusts up to 60 mph near Lake Palmdale and the surrounding foothills. The combination of high winds   which could cause downed power lines   relatively low humidity and temperatures in the 80s raises the risk of fire danger, the weather service said. ""Nothing that comes close to … a red flag warning, but there's an elevated concern,"" Thompson said. ""We're watching, but it's nothing extreme."" Northern California, however, has issued a red flag warning through Saturday , cautioning that gusts of up to 40 mph and low humidity levels between 10% and 15% are creating high fire dangers. The warning, which extends from Sacramento north to Redding, is for elevations below 2,000 feet where wildland fuels are susceptible to rapid spread of fire, said Jim Matthews, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Sacramento. Heavy winter rains have produced an excess amount of vegetation, according to experts. With temperatures heating up across the state, that vegetation will continue to dry and become fire fuel, meteorologist Bonnie Bartling of the weather service said. alejandra.reyesvelarde@latimes.com Twitter: @r_valejandra",environmental issues,Los Angeles Times,left

supreme court faults trump bid to add census citizenship question,"Video by FOX News WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that President Donald Trump's administration did not give an adequate explanation for its plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, delivering a victory to New York state and others challenging the proposal. The justices partly upheld a federal judge's decision barring the question in a win for a group of states and immigrant rights organizations that challenged the plan. The mixed ruling does not definitively decide whether the question could be added at some point. The Republican president's administration had appealed to the Supreme Court after lower courts blocked the inclusion of the census question. A group of states including New York and immigrant rights organizations sued to prevent the citizenship question from being included in the decennial population count. Opponents have said the question would instill fear in immigrant households that the information would be shared with law enforcement, deterring them from taking part. The census, required by the U.S. Constitution, is used to allot seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and distribute some $800 billion in federal funds. The intent of the citizenship question, opponents said, is to manufacture a deliberate undercount of areas with high immigrant and Latino populations, costing Democratic-leaning regions seats in the House, benefiting Republicans and non-Hispanic whites. The administration argued that adding a question requiring people taking part in the census to declare whether they are a citizen was needed to better enforce a voting rights law, a rationale that opponents called a pretext for a political motive. Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman ruled on Jan. 15 that the Commerce Department's decision to add the question violated a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. Federal judges in Maryland and California also have issued rulings to block the question's inclusion, saying it would violate the Constitution's mandate to enumerate the population every 10 years. Furman said the evidence showed that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross concealed his true motives for adding the question and that he and his aides had convinced the Justice Department to request a citizenship question. Businesses also rely on census data to make critical strategic decisions, including where to invest capital. Citizenship has not been asked of all households since the 1950 census, featuring since then only on questionnaires sent to a smaller subset of the population. The Census Bureau's own experts estimated that households corresponding to 6.5 million people would not respond to the census if the citizenship question were asked. While only U.S. citizens can vote, non-citizens comprise an estimated 7 percent of the population. Evidence surfaced in May that the challengers said showed that the administration's plan to add a citizenship question was intended to discriminate against racial minorities. Documents created by Republican strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died last year, showed that he was instrumental behind the scenes in instigating the addition of the citizenship question. He was an expert in drawing electoral district boundaries that maximize Republican chances of winning congressional elections. Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that asking census respondents whether they are American citizens ""would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats"" and ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites"" in redrawing electoral districts based on census data. Hofeller suggested the voting rights rationale in the newly disclosed documents. The Trump administration called the newly surfaced evidence ""conspiracy theory."" A federal judge in Maryland is reviewing the Hofeller evidence. Most people living in the United States will be asked to fill out the census, whether online or on paper, by March 2020.

trump vows to cure cancer and eradicate aids,"As President Trump officially kicked off his 2020 campaign in Orlando Tuesday night, he made sweeping promises to tackle two of mankind's most dreaded diseases. In front of the crowd at a packed Amway Center, Mr. Trump said his administration would work to cure cancer and again vowed to eradicate AIDS if he's elected to a second term. The president spent much of his speech attacking familiar foes and restating his position on issues like immigration. But he also said his administration will ""come up with the cures"" to devastating diseases. ""We will push onward with new medical frontiers,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases including cancer and others. And we're getting closer all the time."" The remarks came after his son, Donald Trump Jr., mocked Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden for making a similar promise to cure cancer. ""Wow, why the hell didn't you do that over the last 50 years, Joe?"" Trump Jr. tweeted. Biden, whose son Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015, founded the Biden Cancer Initiative and told the crowd at a recent campaign event in Iowa, ""I promise you, if I'm elected president, you're going to see the single most important thing that changes America   we're going to cure cancer."" In 2018, an estimated 1,735,350 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the United States and 609,640 people died from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society 's latest statistics. President Trump also called attention at his rally to the fight against HIV and AIDS. In his State of the Union address earlier this year, he vowed to eradicate AIDS by 2030   though critics pointed out his budget proposal the previous year sought to divert money away from HIV/AIDS research to fund detention centers for undocumented immigrant children. In its 2020 budget proposal, the Trump administration has requested $291 million for the first phase of an initiative to reduce new HIV infections in the U.S. The budget also calls for an increase in funding for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, to pay for health care services and support, and another $50 million to expand access to the anti-HIV drug regimen known as PrEP . ""We will eradicate AIDS in America once and for all   and we are really close,"" the president said at his Orlando rally. Approximately 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV today, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Texas executes white supremacist convicted in gruesome 1998 hate crime,"A killer in one of the most gruesome hate crimes in modern U.S. history was executed Wednesday by lethal injection in Texas. John William King, 44, was pronounced dead shortly after 7 p.m. local time in a Hunstville prison after murdering James Byrd, Jr., two decades ago in Jasper, Texas. King and two other white men were convicted of murdering Byrd in the early morning hours of June 7, 1998. They beat Byrd, 49, chained him to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him for three miles down a logging road in Japser County, tearing his body apart. Prosecutors said Byrd was targeted because he was black. King, a white supremacist who orchestrated the attack, is the second man to be executed in the case. Lawrence Russell Brewer was executed in 2011 while Shawn Allen Berry was sentenced to life in prison. Report: Hate group count hits 20-year high amid rise in white supremacy Explainer: Hate crimes are up in America's 10 largest cities The Supreme Court refused a last-day appeal from King shortly before his execution. Prison officials said he was stoic as he awaited the lethal injection, which two of Byrd's sisters and a niece witnessed. One of Byrd's sisters, Clara Byrd Taylor, said the execution was a necessary step in the saga of her brother's murder. ""It's a very, very sad time,"" Taylor, 71, said before the execution. ""You don't feel any satisfaction in observing this but it is absolutely necessary to send a message: Hate crimes   especially this type of savagery   will not be tolerated in our society."" The murder rocked the city of Japser, a city of 7,600 people about 140 miles northeast of Houston, and drew international and national attention. Texas and federal hate crime legislation are named in memory of Byrd. The family also created the Byrd Foundation for Racial Healing , which still raises money for diversity training and scholarships today. The execution may not bring closure for the city's community, said Mia Moody-Ramirez, a Baylor University professor and researcher who has studied the impact of Byrd's murder on Jasper. ""They might say, 'OK, this person has been executed, we could move on,'"" she said before the execution. ""But people won't ever forget.""

"Philly officials appeal court ruling, seek to stop VisionQuest from moving migrant children into Logan shelter","Philadelphia officials have appealed to Commonwealth Court to stop an Arizona-based youth agency from moving undocumented migrant children into its Logan neighborhood shelter. The VisionQuest organization had expected to begin accepting children into its facility at the end of June, after winning the right to proceed last week in Common Pleas Court. The agency plans to house a rotating population of Spanish-speaking boys, ages 12 to 17, most of whom fled gang violence and poverty in Central America, and who have no parent or legal guardian in this country. The city's new filing automatically triggers the equivalent of a preliminary injunction -- blocking the earlier preliminary injunction that allowed VisionQuest to proceed. The agency is expected to move quickly to oppose the city's appeal in Commonwealth Court. ""We're disappointed but not entirely surprised,"" said VisionQuest zoning attorney Carl Primavera. ""The city has been fairly dug in on this from day one. They've been unwilling to reconsider anything that would look like a compromise, or see it under a different perspective."" In the sanctuary city of Philadelphia, the fight to keep VisionQuest from opening has been joined by City Council members, union leaders, immigrant advocates, and Logan residents. Opponents say the city should never allow immigrant children to be confined within its borders, and particularly not by VisionQuest. The agency's previous North Philadelphia shelter closed in 2017 after staff members were found to have punched and choked children there. Now, the agency will be paid up to $5.3 million by the federal government over three years to house the migrant children at the same site. Last week, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Paula Patrick ruled that VisionQuest could proceed with its plan. She said that allowing VisionQuest to open the facility now -- while a larger legal case goes forward -- would cause ""no adverse impact on or jeopardy of health, safety, or welfare of the employees of VisionQuest or the children placed in the shelter."" ___ (c)2019 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at www.philly.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,Philly.com,left
climate crisis: alaska is melting and it's likely to accelerate global heating,"A city in western Alaska has lost a huge stretch of riverbank to erosion that may turn it into an island, amid renewed warnings from scientists over the havoc triggered by the accelerating melting of the state's ice and permafrost. Residents of the small city of Akiak were alarmed to find the Kuskokwim River suddenly much closer to housing after approximately 75ft to 100ft of riverbank disappeared over the course of just a few hours. The erosion, which occurred late last month, stripped away the riverbank for the entire length of Akiak, which has a population of around 340. ""We got about three houses in imminent danger, and the rest of them will be coming along pretty quickly,"" said David Gilila, Akiak's city administrator. Gilila said he was appealing for funding to relocate some homes, warning that the water could soon surround the city. ""We'll still be here, but we'll probably become an island,"" he said. Related: What happened to winter? Vanishing ice convulses Alaskans' way of life The drastic reshaping of Akiak is likely down to thawing permafrost, the frozen organic matter held within soils. Alaska is heating up twice as quickly as the rest of the US as a result of human-driven climate breakdown, increasingly causing this permafrost to thaw and destabilize buildings and cause roads to buckle . ""The changes are really accelerating in Alaska,"" said Susan Natali, a scientist and Arctic expert at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. ""It's pretty likely this riverbank in Akiak was lost because of thawing permafrost, given where it's situated and the warm winter and spring they've had. It's not a problem that's going to go away."" Alaska has just experienced its warmest spring on record , breaking a record only set in 2016. Since the 1970s, springtime in the state has heated up by around 2.2C (4F), double the global temperature rise of the past century. Springtime in Alaska isn't what it used to be. This is the 3rd time past 21 years we can say"" warmest spring of record"". 1998 was the warmest to date, exceeded in 2016 and now 2016 exceeded in 2019.

There is also a growing wildfire threat putting communities at risk. Unless it causes buildings to topple, permafrost thawing is often a more obscure feature of this warming, although it could prove to be among the most significant. As the frozen ground across the Arctic melts, it releases a huge amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Scientists recently found this process could trigger a dangerous acceleration of global heating that would cause tens of trillions of dollars in climate-related damage. A separate study found that parts of the Canadian Arctic are experiencing a rate of permafrost thaw six times the long-term average. In Alaska, there are dozens of towns that the federal government has identified as being in potential need of relocation due to the damage caused by the climate crisis. The village of Newtok in western Alaska was granted $15m last year to start shifting homes to safer ground but the vast majority of communities have no pathway to do likewise. ""It's a real challenge because in the US there isn't the precedence to deal with this and there isn't the political framework to deal with it either,"" said Natali. ""The numbers needing relocation will grow, the costs are going up and people's lives and cultural practices will be impacted. ""Every year there's a new temperature record, it's getting worse and worse and you feel like a broken record saying it. This should be the number one urgent conversation happening right now because it's not just going to be Alaska, it's going to be other communities all over the US,"" Natali added.",environmental issues,AP,center
Trump urges appeals court to block subpoena for his accounting records,"WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked an appeals court on Monday to overturn a ruling that his accounting firm must turn over his financial records from before he was president to the Democratic-controlled House Oversight Committee. Lawyers for Trump said in a court filing that a May 20 decision by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ordering Mazars LLP to comply with the subpoena was flawed and should be reversed. Mehta's ruling was the first time a federal court waded into the tussle about how far Congress can go in probing Trump and his business affairs, and marked an important victory for House Democrats. ""It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct - past or present - even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,"" Mehta said in his ruling. The House of Representatives Oversight Committee has said it needs Trump's financial records to examine whether he has conflicts of interest or broke the law by not disentangling himself from his business holdings, as previous presidents did. Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, the panel's chairman, issued the subpoena to Mazars after Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress in February that Trump had misrepresented his net worth. Trump's lawyers said in Monday's filing that the subpoena was invalid because it was never intended to help Congress perform its core constitutional role of making laws. ""The Committee admits that the whole point is to discover whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct,"" Trump's lawyers said. ""It is an effort to investigate alleged legal violations power that is vested in the Executive, not Congress."" Trump's lawyers told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that if it affirmed Mehta's ruling, it would be endorsing a ""limitless"" view of the congressional power to investigate. The Trump Organization, the president's privately owned real estate company, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Trump is suing in his individual capacity, and is represented by a private law firm rather than government lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice. Mazars has avoided taking a side in the dispute, saying it will comply with its legal obligations.

A young girl was afraid of IVs. So she invented a teddy bear to disguise them,"A young girl from Connecticut turned her time spent in the hospital into a chance to help ease the fear of many other young patients. Ella Casano, now 12, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP) when she was seven. ""It's when her body attacks and destroys its own platelets, so it puts her at higher risk for bleeding or injury, more than most people,"" Meg Casano, Ella's mother, told CNN. Due to ITP, Ella had to have IV infusions every six to eight weeks. As for many young children, and adults, this process scared her. ""When I had my first infusion, I was surprised and a little bit intimidated by the look of the amount of tubing and medical equipment on my IV pole,"" Ella said in a statement on her website . Ella stared down her fear and came up with a creative solution to disguise the medicine. ""So, she cut up a stuffed animal and used a hot glue gun and made her very first Medi Teddy,"" Casano said. Seeing how delighted the nurses were with the idea, Ella and her mother started the process to patent, manufacture and distribute the invention they named Medi Teddy. ""The purpose of the Medi Teddy is to conceal a bag of IV fluid, medication, or blood product from the child who is receiving it and instead provide a friendly face to look at!,"" Casano said. The back side of the pouch is made of mesh so that nurses and doctors can see the status of the medicine the patient is receiving. Ella made several protocols and gave them to her nurses to use for feedback on how to make it better. She then researched business plans at school for an independent study and crafted her own for Medi Teddy. With the help of her mom, they are filing paperwork to make the company a nonprofit organization. On Sunday, they launched a GoFundMe to raise $5,000 so that they can place their first order of 500 units. By Thursday, they surpassed their goal by over $2,000.

Memphis man killed by marshals had history of arrests on minor charges,"June 13 (Reuters) - The Tennessee man killed by U.S. marshals, sparking clashes with police overnight, had a history of arrests on minor drug-related and driving charges and posted a social media video just before his death showing him smoking what appeared to be marijuana. The victim, a Memphis resident identified by authorities as Brandon Webber, was 20 years old and the eldest of eight children. He had two young children of his own, a 2-year-old boy and a newborn daughter. In May, Webber posted a picture of his infant daughter on Facebook and wrote that she ""stole my."" His father, Sonny Webber, told Reuters on Thursday that his son was expecting to attend the University of Memphis in August. Agents of the U.S. Marshals Service shot and killed the younger Webber while trying to arrest him on multiple warrants at about 7 p.m. on Wednesday, the state Bureau of Investigation said, without specifying the nature of the warrants. Webber's father said his son was shot between 16 and 20 times, but the number of shots could not be immediately confirmed. Shortly before he was shot on Wednesday, Webber posted a live video on Facebook that showed him in a car, rapping and apparently smoking a marijuana cigarette. In the video, he looked out the window and said he saw police. With a laugh, he looked directly into the camera and said the officers would ""have to kill me."" The video appeared to have been removed from his Facebook page late Thursday morning. In the hours after his death, friends flooded Webber's Facebook profile with messages of love, grief, disbelief and outrage at the authorities responsible for his death. ""I don't see a man that deserves 20 shots. I see a father, a friend, a big bro, a rapper from the heart ... a song writer, a college student, a homie, a brother,"" wrote Derrion Davenport, who posted a picture of Webber looking down at his newborn baby. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Webber rammed his vehicle into vehicles operated by the U.S. Marshals Service before getting out with an unspecified weapon. The service, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, is charged with apprehending fugitives. Public records show that Webber was arrested five times, for driving violations and on charges that included possession of drug paraphernalia and marijuana. The outcome of those arrests was not clear from the records. According to his Facebook profile, Webber had graduated from Memphis Central High School.

"google assistant is better than alexa or siri at helping patients with their drugs, study finds","A new study found that Google Assistant was better than its rivals at understanding medications. Studies are indicating that voice assistants aren't ready yet to be reliably used for health and medical applications. In the race among tech companies to bring their voice recognition technology into the realm of personal medicine, Google is the furthest along, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Nature Digital Medicine. Researchers Yan Fossat and Adam Palanica from lab company Klick Health in Toronto tested technology from Google, Amazon and Apple to gauge how well their services comprehended the 50 most commonly prescribed medicines and whether they could provide accurate information to users. Fossat and Palanica said they activated Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Apple's Siri and played individual audio clips from 46 English speaking people with the prompt, ""Tell me about,"" followed by the medication name. ""We reviewed all the literature, and identified this one area of medication comprehension that is under studied,"" said Fossat, in an interview with CNBC. ""It's especially important to research these voice assistant tools, given the growing demand for them in health care."" None of the leading voice-activated home speakers were specifically intended for the medical sector, but research indicates they're increasingly being used for medication information and reminders, and there's rising interest in the technology in patients' homes, doctors' offices and hospitals. Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo has the dominant market share among consumers, but for this purpose Google's technology is currently better, according to Fossat and Palanica's findings from research conducted between late 2018 and mid-January of this year. Google Assistant understood 92% of brand name medicines, and 84% of generics, they found. Siri had just over 58% comprehension of brand names and 51% with generics, while Alexa came in at 55% and 46%, respectively. Google Assistant showed similar results even for people who spoke with different accents, but Siri and Alexa had lower comprehension rates in those instances. Klick Health specializes in commercializing and researching the latest health technologies. Palanica is a behavioral scientist trained at the University of Waterloo, while Fossat is a principal investigator who heads up the lab. 'Opportunity to become the medical hub' Tech companies are actively adapting their offerings to appeal to the health-care industry . Amazon recently announced to developers that Alexa is ""HIPAA compliant,"" meaning it can work with select companies on ""skills"" that involve users' sensitive health information, including checking a medical status or making a doctor's appointment. Voice assistants today are still inconsistent in how they respond to questions about health emergencies and in many cases have failed to refer people to the proper places for help, according to some studies. Other research concluded that Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant should not be relied up for actionable medical information and could even pose a safety risk . ""Smart speakers have a huge opportunity to become the medical hub of the home,"" said John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital. ""It's important to start benchmarking the ability of these tools to understand medical terms so they can continue to evolve to serve patients.""

Did Jared Kushner Violate the Hatch Act? Democrats Request Investigation After Kellyanne Conway Findings,"The Office of Special Counsel's recommendation last week that Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway be removed from service for violating the Hatch Act led two Democratic congressman on Monday to demand an investigation into whether the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner similarly broke federal law. In a letter to Special Counsel Henry Kerner, who last Thursday recommended that Trump remove Conway, Representatives Donald Beyer Jr. of Virginia and Ted Lieu of California requested a probe into whether Kushner violated the Hatch Act by ""engaging in prohibited campaign fundraising activities."" The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from fundraising for political candidates and only the president and vice president are exempt. Butthe congressmen, citing recent media reports, accused Kushner, in his official White House role, of ""taking a direct role in raising funds"" for Trump's reelection campaign. In February, a Trump 2020 campaign release referred to Kushner as ""Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President, and President Trump's son-in-law,"" before being amended to simply, ""President Trump's son-in-law."" Last month, Yahoo reported that Kushner had several discussions per day with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and plays a key liaison role. The New York Times then reported a meeting Kushner arranged at the White House with Parscale, the Republican National Committee chair, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and major donors to talk about the fundraising strategy. ""We have strong reason to believe that Jared Kushner is in violation of both the spirit and the letter of that Act,"" the congressmen wrote. Beyer and Lieu stated that Kushner's ""poor track record of compliance with the spirit of the Hatch Act,"" including the discussions and using his official title in Trump campaign materials, ""merit enhanced scrutiny."" ""Jared Kushner has repeatedly benefited from special treatment; as with his many deceptions regarding his security clearance this is something no rank-and-file federal employee would get away with,"" Beyer tweeted. ""He shouldn't."" Lieu has been a longtime critic of Kushner and his top security clearance, which was revoked and then reinstated against the advice of career national security officials reportedly after Trump intervened. ""National security is more important than party. Jared Kushner lied on his SF-86 form and must lose his security clearance,"" Lieu tweeted in July 2017, along with the hashtag #RevokeKushner. The White House and the Office of Special Counsel did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Newsweek on Monday on the call to investigate Kushner. Trump on Friday refused to fire Conway and defended her by saying, ""it looks to me like they're trying to take away her right to free speech and that's just not fair.""

trump makes history in north korea: what we know now,"Slideshow by photo services A social media ask for a quick handshake turned historic Sunday when President Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to step foot in North Korea during a meeting in the Demilitarized Zone with Kim Jong Un. ""Stepping across that line was a great honor,"" Trump told the North Korean leader, adding that it was a ""a great day for the world."" Trump had said the duo would merely conduct a brief handshake, but they ultimately met for almost an hour. Afterward, Trump said each leader will provide a team of negotiators for talks aimed at persuading Kim to dismantle a nuclear weapons program that has kept the Korean Peninsula on edge for years. Trump reaches out to Kim on Twitter Trump suggested the meeting in a tweet on Thursday: ""After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!"" Kim agrees to meeting Trump, while still in Japan, said the Koreans had responded ""very favorably"" to his suggestion. On Sunday, Kim gave Trump props for reaching out. ""I believe this is an expression of his willingness to eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future,"" he said. A photo opportunity, and maybe more Cameras clicked and whirred as Trump, during a planned visit to South Korea, made his sidetrip to the DMZ for the handshake seen around the world. Kim asked Trump if he wanted to step into North Korea, and the duo took about 10 steps in the North. They then walked back before retreating to Freedom House for their private chat. They emerged with an agreement to kick-start talks that had seen little movement since their February summit in Vietnam. Live from the DMZ: Donald Trump meets Kim Jong Un Limos, vokda nukes: A sanctions' sleuth traces North Korea's illicit transactions What happens now? Foreign policy analysts said the border meeting won't mean much unless it it leads to progress on a deal to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons programs. ""What matters is what is agreed to and actually happens,"" tweeted Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It is not the personal but policy that counts."" Harry Kazianis, with the D.C.-based Center for the National Interest, sounded a positive note, saying the meeting could ""set the tone for ... carving out a path toward lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula."" Pope Francis prays for deal Pope Francis praised the meeting in his weekly address at St. Peter's Square, saying he prays that ""such a significant gesture will be a further step on the road to peace, not only on that peninsula, but for the good of the entire world."" We've been here before The Hanoi summit fell apart after Trump rejected Kim's calls for sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, something that U.S. officials see as a partial denuclearization step. Kim has since fired missiles and other weapons into the sea. The duo also met a year ago in Singapore, but no deal emerged. Nukes on the Korean Peninsula North Korea withdrew from the global the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 2003. Three years later the rogue state conducted the first of a half-dozen increasingly complex nuclear tests. In July 2017, North Korea conducted what was believed to be a successful test of an ICBM   Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The price of militarization Pyongyang's military upgrades have come at a price   a series of increasingly stiff economic sanctions that has crippled its economy. Trump has expressed a willingness to remove sanctions and provide economic aid if Kim is willing to end his nuclear program.

tutankhamun sculpture's london auction sparks egyptian outcry,"A 3,000-year-old head sculpture of an eternally-young Tutankhamun -- the Egyptian pharaoh known as King Tut -- goes under the hammer this week in London despite an outcry from Cairo. Christie's expects the 28.5-centimetre (11-inch) brown quartzite relic from the Valley of the Kings to fetch more than £4 million ($5.1 million, 4.5 million euros) on Thursday. The Financial Times reported that it was the first such Egyptian statuette to go on the market since 1985. The pharaoh's finely-chiselled head -- its serene eyes and puffed lips emoting a sense of eternal peace -- comes from the private Resandro Collection of ancient art that Christie's last sold in 2016 for £3 million. But Egyptian authorities overseeing the north African country's unparalleled collection of antiquities want to see the auction halted and the treasure returned. ""The Egyptian embassy in London requested the British foreign affairs ministry and the auction hall to stop the sale,"" Egypt's foreign ministry said on June 10. Former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told AFP on Sunday that the piece appears to have been ""stolen"" in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple complex of Egypt's great monuments. ""The owners have given false information,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""They have not shown any legal papers to prove its ownership."" The French-owned British auction house explained that the current lot was acquired by Resandro from a Munich-based dealer in 1985. It traces its prior origins to the 1973-74 acquisition by another dealer in Austria from the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis in modern-day Germany. The trail peters out shortly afterwords and little is known to the public about how the statue found its way to Europe. ""Ancient objects by their nature cannot be traced over millennia,"" Christie's said in a statement released to AFP. ""It is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done,"" it added. ""We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export."" Britain's Foreign Office has been in touch with Egyptian authorities but is not expected to intervene. - 'Legitimate market' - Tutankhamun is thought to have become a pharaoh at the age of nine and to have died about 10 years later. His rule would have probably passed without notice were it not for the 1922 discovery by Britain's Howard Carter of his nearly intact tomb. The lavish find revived interest in ancient Egypt and set the stage for subsequent battles over ownership of cultural masterpieces unearthed in colonial times. International conventions and the British government's own guidance restrict the sale of works that were known to have been stolen or illegally dug up. The British Museum has been wrangling for decades with Greece over its remarkable room full of marble Parthenon friezes and sculptures. Egypt's own campaign to recover lost art gained momentum after numerous works went missing during the looting that accompanied former president Hosni Mubarak's fall from power in 2011. The late Egyptian strongman turned the existing supreme council of antiquities into a separate ministry in the last year of his rule. It has worked with the Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation Institute to mend Tutankhamun's tomb from the damage it sustained from swarming tourists over recent years. The ministry also asked the UN cultural body UNESCO to halt Christie's sale. But Egypt has been unable to substantiate its case with firm proof that the bust was illegally obtained. The London auction house said in its defence that there was a ""legitimate market for works of art of the ancient world in which Christie's has participated for generations"".",health,Associated Press,center
"George Tyndall had a gun when he was arrested for alleged sexual assault, police chief says","Women who accused a former University of Southern California gynecologist of sexual misconduct welcomed his arrest after allegations involving hundreds of patients over several years. George Tyndall practiced at USC for almost 30 years. He was charged Wednesday with 18 counts of sexual assault, according to a criminal complaint filed by Los Angeles prosecutors. He also faces 11 counts of sexual battery by fraud. The criminal complaint alleges Tyndall inappropriately touched 16 women between 2009 and 2016 when he worked at the university's student health center. The women ranged in age from 17 to 29, prosecutors said. Tyndall told some of the women the touching was for a professional purpose when it was for sexual gratification, the complaint alleges. The more than a dozen women are just a small part of the hundreds who've accused him of sexual misconduct. Aside from the criminal investigations by the police, hundreds of women have sued the doctor and the university. Attorney John Manly, who represents about 200 women in the suit against USC, said his clients are relieved he's off the streets. ""They've been living on eggshells,"" he said. He complained of chest pains, police chief says When Tyndall was arrested Wednesday as he left his apartment, he was carrying a .38-caliber revolver with a 2-inch barrel, police Chief Michel Moore said. He complained of chest pains and was hospitalized, the chief said. The investigation continues, and more charges are possible, District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Her office said it reached a sufficient number of cases to file charges one year into the investigation. Tyndall, who was fired two years ago, has denied allegations of wrongdoing. ""After a year of being tried in the press, Dr. Tyndall looks forward to finally having his case adjudicated in a court of law,"" attorney Leonard Levine said. ""He remains confident that he will be totally exonerated."" Tyndall's arraignment, where he will plead to the charges, has not been scheduled. He faces decades in prison If convicted on the 29 charges, he could face up to 53 years in prison. The news comes two weeks after a federal court approved a preliminary amount of $215 million for a victims' fund. A university lawyer told CNN last year that as many as 17,000 women could qualify for the class action settlement.",crime,CNN,left
House Democrats to hold hearing next week on treatment of migrant children,"The House Oversight and Reform Committee has scheduled a hearing next week to hear testimony from Trump administration officials about the separation and treatment of immigrant children at the southern border. Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) has invited acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan to testify at a hearing on July 12. Neither have confirmed their appearance, according to the committee. ""The Trump Administration's actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,"" Cummings said in a statement Tuesday. ""There seems to be open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency. The committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance,"" Cummings said, adding that he hoped McAleenan and Morgan would appear ""voluntarily"" at the hearing. The announcement closely followed the release of a new Homeland Security inspector general report describing ""dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention"" of immigrant children and adults at facilities in the Rio Grande Valley that require ""immediate attention and action."" The report, issued Tuesday, says that 31 percent of children at the facilities were being held longer than the 72 hours permitted, according to Border Patrol custody data. The hearing is expected to focus on reports of unaccompanied children being held in overcrowded and dirty facilities in Clint, Texas, and other parts of the country, as well as the newly issued inspector general report. A cadre of Democratic lawmakers visited a border facility in Clint on Tuesday to survey the conditions and investigate reports of mistreatment of migrants. Cummings has also sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting information related to the committee's investigation into a report that Border Patrol agents used a secret Facebook group to mock immigrants and members of Congress and post racist and sexist content. The hearing next Friday is also expected to focus on the Facebook posts. In a letter to the acting Homeland Security chief on Tuesday, Cummings said he received a letter from McAleenan's staff requesting a separate panel for the hearing but suggesting he may not be able to appear on July 12. Cummings had initially requested that he testify on June 28. ""To address your staff's request on panel structure, the Committee will allow you and Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan to testify on your own panel for this hearing,"" Cummings wrote. The chairman refused to postpone the hearing in light of recent ""troubling revelations"" about the conditions at migrant facilities. ""As Acting Secretary, you lead the agency responsible for these actions and these conditions, and your testimony is critical to the Committee's review,"" Cummings wrote. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. In the separate letter to Zuckerberg, Cummings asked that Facebook preserve ""all documents, communications and other data"" related to the Facebook group known as ""I'm 10-15."" According to a new report from ProPublica , current and former border agents who are members of the secret Facebook group posted derogatory comments about migrants and Latino members of Congress. Cummings also asked the Facebook CEO to produce by July 9 ""all postings and comments"" including pictures and deleted content related to the group from the date the group was created to present day. The Facebook group is said to be three years old. Updated at 4:35 p.m.",politics,The Hill,center
"wider center, digital signs: improvements abound in new sound transit light rail cars","On a full light rail car, it can be hard to hear announcements. And that can be frustrating to passengers packed in and waiting, especially when something out-of-the-ordinary occurs, causing travel delays. But digital signs inside new Sound Transit light rail vehicles will be able to share such messages with passengers in a written format. It's just one of a handful of changes that will directly impact passengers using the new light rail cars, which should begin rolling out for use early next year. ""These cars were designed with the riders of Puget Sound in mind,"" Robin Stimson, vice president of business development for Siemens, said during a media preview of the new light rail cars, which Siemens designed and built over a span of two years. The first car was recently delivered to Sound Transit's operations and maintenance facility in Seattle's Industrial District. Sound Transit expects to receive one to three cars each month until all 152 new vehicles, costing $642 million total, have been delivered -- about five years from now. RELATED: Today in history: King County voters reject proposals for regional rail transit Those deliveries will more than triple the agency's light rail car fleet, which now consists of 62 vehicles. The higher number of cars will be critical for ST2 and ST3 expansions, which will connect downtown Seattle to locales like Lynnwood (slated to open in 2024) and Everett (slated to open in 2036) to the north; Redmond and Bellevue to the east, set to open in 2024 and 2023; and Federal Way and Tacoma to the south, set to open in 2024 and 2030, respectively. Neighborhoods including West Seattle and Ballard are also slated to get their own expansions in 2030 and 2035, respectively. The whole system will total 116 miles and cost tens of billions to design and build. The high cost of car tabs as a result of voter-passed initiatives to expand the light rail has been controversial . When it's complete, Sound Transit expects the expanded light rail network to carry 200,000 riders per day, on 214 vehicles strung into four-car trains. Current trains are two or three cars long. RELATED: You can now see all transit in Seattle on one map, at the same time The new cars appear very similar to the current cars on first glance, but there are some notable improvements. In addition to the dynamic digital signs, the area of seats facing one another is wider, to help prevent knee knocking and help accommodate large bags, while allowing for a comfortable entrance and egress. The crowded nature of this area of seats makes them ""less desirable to some riders,"" Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff told SeattlePI. Plus, the wider aisles and larger windows create better sight lines for passengers seated in this area. They will have a better idea of where they are while traveling. Each car will seat 74 people and has the capacity for four bicycles. Current light rail cars can only carry two bikes. Bike racks will also have a seat for the rear tire, unlike current light rail bike racks. RELATED: 100 years ago: Seattle buys private streetcar system, which was the beginning of the end For Sound Transit officials, the delivery of the first new light rail car was a signal that the agency will do more than block roads and create mess with construction.

"ap fact check: trump promises not just the moon, but mars","WASHINGTON   President Donald Trump dismissed the hard realities of his trade dispute with China as mere foolishness Monday and told people to expect humans on Mars ""very shortly,"" which isn't happening. Here's a look at some of his statements in a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and how they stack up with reality: TRADE TRUMP: ""You know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no   it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars."" THE FACTS: That's not true. U.S. consumers and the public are primarily if not entirely paying the costs of the tariffs, as his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has acknowledged . That's how tariffs work: Importers pay the taxes and often pass on the cost to consumers. The U.S. is not ""taking in"" billions from China as a result. A sustained trade dispute is not painless for China, either. Its goods become pricier and therefore less competitive. But China is not paying a tab to the U.S. treasury in this matter. As Kudlow said, accurately: ""Both sides will suffer on this."" But in his view, ""this is a risk we should and can take."" ___ MARS TRUMP: ""Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to dramatically expand our nations' cooperation in human space exploration. Japan will join our mission to send U.S. astronauts to space. We'll be going to the moon. We'll be going to Mars very soon."" THE FACTS: Not very soon. The U.S. will almost certainly not be sending humans to Mars in his presidency, even if he wins a second term. The Trump administration has a placed a priority on the moon over Mars for human exploration (President Barack Obama favored Mars) and hopes to accelerate NASA's plan for returning people to the lunar surface. It has asked Congress to approve enough money to make a moon mission possible by 2024, instead 2028. But even if that happens, Mars would come years after that. International space agencies have made aspirational statements about possibly landing humans on Mars during the 2030s. ___ TRUMP on Iran : ""If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access   free access   to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?"" THE FACTS: That's a misrepresentation of what the deal required . Iran would not have access to nuclear weapons capability in a ""very short period"" without violating the terms of the 2015 accord. The U.S. withdrew from the multinational agreement last year. During the 15-year life of most provisions of the deal, Iran's capabilities were limited to a level where it could not produce a nuclear bomb. Iran was thought to be only months away from a bomb when the deal came into effect. After 15 years, Iran could have an array of advanced centrifuges ready to work, the limits on its stockpile would be gone and, in theory, it could then throw itself into producing highly enriched uranium. But nothing in the deal prevented the West from trying to rein Iran in again with sanctions. The deal included a pledge by Iran never to seek a nuclear weapon. In return, partners in the deal eased sanctions on Iran. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",science,The Boston Globe,left
"Georgia carries out 1,500th U.S. execution since penalty was reinstated","By Brendan O'Brien (Reuters) - Georgia on Thursday carried out the 1,500th execution in the United States since 1976, the year capital punishment was reinstated, by putting to death a man convicted of killing an off-duty prison guard in 1996. Marion Wilson, 42, who was put to death by lethal injection, was declared dead at 9:52 p.m. EDT at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, the state's department of corrections said in a statement. Wilson was the 1,500th inmate executed since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, four years after declaring existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional, the Death Penalty Information Center said. The first person executed after the reinstatement was convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who died by firing squad in Utah in 1977 after requesting execution. Since then, Texas leads all states in executions, with 561, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Wilson, executed on Thursday, had been convicted in 1997 of murdering Donovan Parks southeast of Atlanta and sentenced to death, court records show. On March 28, 1996, Parks went into a Wal-Mart in Milledgeville to purchase cat food, leaving his 1992 Acura Vigor parked in the fire lane in front of the store, state prosecutors said. After Parks left the store, Wilson and an accomplice, Robert Butts Jr., carjacked him. Wilson pulled the victim by his tie out of the car and onto the pavement and Butts shot him in the head, the records showed. The two tried to sell the car at a shop in Atlanta that stripped down vehicles, but were turned down. Afterward, they set it on fire, court records showed. Butts was put to death in 2018 for the murder. Wilson was the 10th inmate executed in the United States in 2019 and the second in Georgia, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

"editorial: six months after california's landmark police transparency law, many agencies still won't release their records","Sexual assaults . Planted drugs. Illegal choke holds. We've learned quite a bit about police misconduct in the six months since SB1421 , the landmark transparency bill from state Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, went into effect on Jan. 1. But the biggest thing we've learned is that many police departments believe that compliance with the law is optional. SB1421 requires police departments to release internal affairs records, many of which had been under seal for decades, documenting serious incidents including use-of-force incidents, sustained findings of sexual assault, and sustained findings of police dishonesty. Previous to SB1421's passage, California had some of the strictest confidentiality standards for police records in the nation. But the public has the right to know about these very serious events, which is why it was so important to pass SB1421. Another reason we know why SB1421 is important? So many police departments are resisting compliance. The California Highway Patrol, for example, employs more than 7,300 officers but has yet to produce the records required under the law. Media organizations have reported that their requests to many large police departments, including Long Beach, have not been honored. San Jose, California's third-largest city, hasn't released any of the new law's required, requested documents yet . The San Francisco Police Department has released only documentation from a handful of officer-involved shootings, and no disciplinary records. ""Law enforcement in San Francisco is deliberately sandbagging the release of these records,"" Jacque Wilson, San Francisco's deputy public defender, said at a June 5 police commission meeting . The public defender's office has discussed litigation in an effort to speed along the release of the records. Other police departments have attempted to avoid their responsibilities under the law by charging exorbitant fees for the records. Finally, some police agencies   Fremont and Morgan Hill are among them   destroyed their internal record archives dating before Jan. 1. This is lawless conduct, and it's depriving the public from the right to know about the activities of police in their communities. Police groups even tried to avoid complying with SB1421 by pushing a novel argument in the courts. They claimed that the law did not apply to records dated before 2019. Two different courts ruled against them . But the fact that these groups have had a powerful champion in their attempts to deny the public this information   Attorney General Xavier Becerra   is another signal that this fight isn't going away anytime soon. To her credit, Skinner isn't giving up. She's planning to call for oversight hearings, and has said she's open to amending the bill to require agencies to release records more rapidly. Sadly, both of these actions may be necessary. Another option may be for interested parties   including news media organizations, free speech advocates, and, in some cases, city attorneys   to force compliance through the courts. This action would be expensive, time-consuming and slow. Becerra's obvious bias toward the police groups could prove an obstacle, too. But doing nothing is not an acceptable option. The passage of SB1421 was a hard-fought battle to give the public transparency about police misconduct in their communities. No one   least of all the agencies that have sworn to protect and serve the public   should be allowed to thwart the law. This commentary is from The Chronicle's editorial board.

"Massive 30-acre project with rowhomes, apartments, planned for waterfront","Nearly 1,100 new homes, including apartments and rowhouses, are coming to a currently vacant 30-acre site on the Delaware River. The project, which just went in front of the Civic Design Review (CDR), spans a plot of land between the waterfront and Beach Street in Olde Richmond, just below Graffiti Pier , according to plans posted on the CDR website last week. The project is designed by ISA Architects and Hickok Cole. The plans, which refer to the overall development as a ""hybrid community,"" call for four seven-story apartment buildings on the eastern side of the site with just shy of 850 units total, ranging from one to two-beds. The apartments also include a total of 744 parking spots, a community center with an outdoor plaza, and a community pavilion. A road separates the apartment buildings from the complex of 248 rowhomes on the riverfront side of the land. Those range from three to five beds, and include roof decks and either one- or two-car parking. As part of the Delaware River Waterfront Cooperation's (DRWC) master plan, the project includes green space between the buildings, a pedestrian connection to trails on the water's edge, and an access point to a public park, according to the plans. ""The project will create a new center of gravity to the DRWC plan at the north, encouraging linkages along the entire waterfront,"" the plan said. The overall design acts as a nod to the rowhomes in the adjacent Fishtown and Old Richmond neighborhoods, but the site itself is, ""disconnected,"" from the fabric of those homes, the plans said. At a CDR meeting Tuesday, the plan received largely favorable reviews, with Dan Garofalo praising its aesthetics and saying the site could end up becoming a new neighborhood, according to a report by PlanPhilly . It's the latest and arguably the largest  project to tap the northern banks of the Delaware River for residential development. A little further south, multiple projects like the Views at Penn Treaty , a luxury development with 19 townhouses, and Pier 35 1/2 , a 41-townhouse development have all moved forward in recent months. Just to the north, in Bridesburg, a DRWC plan for a 10-acre park recently received a grant.",environmental issues,PlanPhilly,left
report: pg&e ignored repairs on aging power lines,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)   Pacific Gas & Electric, which is blamed for some of California's deadliest recent fires, knew for years that dozens of its aging power lines posed a wildfire threat but avoided replacing or repairing them, it was reported Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal, using company documents obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act, reported that the utility told the U.S. Forest Service in 2017 and 2018 that 49 aging steel towers on one transmission line needed replacement and another 57 needed replacement of their hardware and aluminum lines. The Journal previously reported that PG&E delayed safety work on the line, known as the Caribou-Palermo line, for five years. State investigators said an equipment failure on that line sparked a November wildfire that essentially wiped out the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 85 people. It was the deadliest and most destructive in state history. On Wednesday, the Butte County Sheriff's Office identified a previously unnamed victim as 67-year-old Shirley Haley of Paradise. Four other people have been tentatively identified while two bodies remain unidentified. After the fire, PG&E decided to stop using the line, which was built in 1921. PG&E also estimated back in 2017 that its towers had an average age of 68 years and some were more than a century old, the Journal said, reporting that the company also said it needed a plan to replace towers and better manage lines to prevent electrical conductors from falling on the ground and causing fires. Gusty winds that can topple trees and down power lines are concerns for California utilities. Last month, PG&E briefly cut power to thousands of people in selected portions of Northern California to guard against wildfires as the weather turned very windy, dry and hot. Also in June, PG&E said its workers discovered more than 1,000 high-priority safety risks on its transmission lines and distribution poles over several months of inspections and almost all of them had been fixed. A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday ordered PG&E to provide a ""paragraph-by-paragraph"" response to the Wall Street Journal story. PG&E must provide ""a fresh, forthright statement owning up to the true extent"" of the Wall Street Journal report by July 31, ordered U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing PG&E's probation for a natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010 that killed eight people in San Bruno. Alsup also asked the company to explain its payment of $5 billion in dividends in recent years ""at a time when PG&E was aware of the problems"" named in the Journal report. PG&E said it disagreed with the conclusions of the Journal report but ""we have acknowledged that the devastation of the 2017 and 2018 wildfires made clear that we must do more to combat the threat of wildfires and extreme weather while hardening our systems."" ""As we have disclosed publicly, we are taking significant actions to inspect, identify, and fix these issues with our electric system,"" the utility said in a statement, adding that ""while the number of safety issues we have identified on our electric system is small by percentage, it's unacceptable."" PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January in the face of some $30 billion in potential liability from 2017 and 2018 wildfire damage.",crime,Associated Press,center
Trendy Chicago Restaurant Is Praised And Put Down After Trump's Son Is Spat Upon,"CHICAGO (CBS)   She's accused of spitting on President Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump. A waitress at a trendy Fulton Market cocktail lounge is now suspended. CBS 2 political reporter Derrick Blakley has the story from the Fulton Market District with a look at what happened. On social media, The Aviary, is now being praised by Trump opponents for being part of the resistance. At the same time, it's being vilified by Trump supporters for undue disrespect toward the first family, all the while the owners of the restaurant said it's not a debate that they want to be part of. Eric Trump went to The Aviary for a business meeting, but got a lot more than the exotic drinks and high-end food he was expecting. According to a spokesperson for the Trump Organization, the president's private business where Eric is Executive Vice President, a waitress at The Aviary spit in Eric Trump's face. Eric cast the act in political terms, telling Breitbart News: ""It was a purely disgusting act by somebody who clearly has emotional problems. For a party that preaches tolerance, this once again demonstrates they have very little civility."" Eric Trump said Chicago police wanted to press charges, but he declined. The Aviary is co-owned by Grant Achatz and Nick Kokonas, also owners of Alinea, known around the world for their highly inventive food and drinks. But the owners said they weren't entirely sure what happened. ""What is certain is this: no customer should ever be spit upon. We have not spoken with the employee but our human resources team has. In the meantime, placed her on leave."" And the owners criticized those both heaping praise or scorn upon their restaurant. ""Hundreds of people are calling for the demise of our business, threatening our employees and posting fake reviews…they are wrong to do so based on the actions of a lone individual. So too, however, are those people wrong who are praising this as an act of civil disobedience. A degrading act lowers the tenor of debate."" For his part, Nick Kokonas has stepped slightly into political waters before. After President Trump served Clemson's national football champs fast food at the White House, Kokonas invited them to Chicago for what an actual celebration dinner should be. Eric Trump said the waitress was detained in handcuffs for two hours by the Secret Service and by Chicago police before he declined to press charges.",crime,CBS,left
Owner of Bobo the slain tiger dies at 77,"To outsiders, he was the eccentric ""Tarzan"" actor who fed his pet lions and tigers by hand. But to those who knew him, Steve Sipek was a gentle giant who never really recovered from the tragic loss of his precious Bobo, a Bengal tiger shot dead by a wildlife officer in 2004. Sipek, a Croatian-born actor who blamed the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission for the ""murder"" of 6-year-old Bobo, died Saturday. He was 77. ""He was larger than life,"" said Melanie Boynes, a teacher who befriended Sipek after Bobo was killed. ""He was soft-spoken for being as big as he was, 6-foot-4 and over 200 pounds. Everybody knew him. But he was always Steve to me. Not Tarzan."" Sipek, a former champion body builder, starred in a Spanish remake of ""Tarzan"" in 1970. According to a former website set up by Sipek, his love of big cats began during the filming of another ""Tarzan"" film. When a fire scene blazed out of control on set, a lion trained to save him in the film did so in real life. 'They murdered my Bobo' Fifteen years ago, Sipek made headlines when 600-pound Bobo escaped his five-acre Loxahatchee compound. Sipek wanted to bring Bobo home, but 26 hours later, his beloved tiger was dead. ""They murdered my Bobo,"" a distraught Sipek said at the time. The incident sparked a widespread outcry , with animal lovers taunting wildlife officers with outraged emails and death threats. A candlelight vigil for Bobo near Sipek's home attracted a crowd of at least 1,000 supporters. Some held signs saying, ""Save a tiger, shoot a wildlife officer."" In 2012, wildlife officers raided Sipek's compound and seized a trio of big cats from the property, citing caging violations. Sipek was arrested and jailed for one day. The following year, a judge ruled the animals should go to a big cat rescue in Okeechobee, close enough for Sipek to visit. But when Sipek's black leopard died a few years later, a friend who runs an exotic animal sanctuary in Live Oak offered to take in his tigers, Bo and Lepa. Sipek moved too, leaving behind his life in Loxahatchee. ""He walked away from everything he knew and a home he'd had for 50 years so he could be with his cats,"" said Vera Chaples, who runs the Mystic Jungle sanctuary in Live Oak. When Bobo died, Sipek buried him on the grounds of his compound next to a tombstone with an image of a tiger engraved in the marble. Saved by a lion When Sipek packed up his belongings for the move, he brought along Bobo's headstone and 18 others made for all the big cats still buried on the property, Chaples said. ""He wanted to dig them up, but I told him it was not a good idea,"" she said. ""I can tell you this, those cats were his life. They were his family."" Sipek's obsession with big cats began during his acting days, Chaples said. ""He was tied to a stake and the set caught on fire,"" she said. ""A lion rushed in and dragged him to safety. And he pledged his allegiance to cats after that."" Sipek left his last two tigers, Bo and Lepa, to Boynes. She visits them just about every day and manages their Facebook page, lordandladyofliveoak . ""I don't think he ever got over Bobo,"" Boynes said of Sipek. ""I didn't expect him to die now. But now he will live on through Bo and Lepa. He'll always be with me, through them.""

'Beyond reprehensible': Fertility doctor who used his own sperm to impregnate 11 women loses license,"Canadian medical authorities have revoked the license of a fertility doctor who was found to have used his own sperm, or the wrong sperm, when he artificially inseminated between 50 and 100 patients. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario determined that Dr. Norman Barwin is incompetent, ""committed an act of professional misconduct"" and engaged in acts that ""would reasonably be regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonorable or unprofessional."" The college initiated an investigation in 2016 after a class action lawsuit was filed against Barwin, 80. Eleven cases of artificial insemination were genetically matched to Barwin through DNA testing. The allegations date to the 1970s and involved patients at the Ottawa General Hospital and another area clinic. In one case detailed in the lawsuit, a woman identified as Patient B conceived a child using what she thought was sperm from an anonymous donor in the 1990s. Her daughter contacted an online DNA registry looking for half-siblings in late 2015 and found a second cousin who she discovered as a relative of Barwin through family tree research. She contacted Barwin, who arranged a DNA test that confirmed he was her biological father. Barwin told her and Patient B's husband that his paternity must have occurred because of accidental contamination after he failed to clean an automated counting chamber that he tested using his own sperm. Dr. Edward G. Hughes, an obstetrician/gynecologist who practices fertility medicine and was hired by the college to review Barwin's case, outlined several reasons why this explanation was implausible. ""For a single pregnancy to have occurred in these ways would have been remarkable,"" Hughes wrote. ""For eleven pregnancies to have been sired in this way, over two or more decades is neither statistically plausible nor believable."" College officials reprimanded Barwin on Tuesday, calling his actions ""beyond reprehensible,"" the Ottawa Citizen reported. ""Your patients represent a group who were vulnerable and who placed themselves and their families completely in your trust,"" disciplinary committee chair Dr. Steven Bodley told Barwin's lawyer. ""You betrayed that trust and by your actions deeply affected individuals and their families and caused irreparable damage that will span generations."" Barwin received a two-month suspension in 2013 after he admitted to using the wrong sperm in four cases. After another complaint indicated that a child was conceived with the wrong sperm, Barwin voluntarily resigned his certificate of registration in 2014. On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel revoked Barwin's license and fined him just over $10,000 CAD ($7,867 USD).

tanker collision sends thousands of gallons of gas product leaking into bay,"A collision between a massive tanker and two oil barges has resulted in as much as tens of thousands of gallons of a gasoline product leaking into a shipping channel near Houston. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed the accident, which took place about 3:30 p.m. local time, in the Houston Ship Channel, near Bayport, Texas. A 755-foot tanker collided with a tug pushing two barges filled with 25,000 gallons of reformate each. The hull of the tanker punctured two of the barges' four storage tanks, Jim Guidry, executive Vice President of Kirby Corporation, which owns the barges, said at a Saturday morning press conference, the Houston Chronicle reported . ""The bow of the ship went through the port tank into the starboard tank, so there was no way to secure the source of the leak,"" Guidry said, according to t he newspaper ""Those two tanks were open to the sea."" Reformate is an intermediate stage in the production of gasoline and is colorless, flammable and toxic to marine life. Air monitoring tests were completed overnight and results released on Saturday morning found there was no danger to the public found, according to Houston ABC station KTRK . . Officials said that 26 teams of air monitors have taken over 1300 samples. All samples have not exceeded actionable levels. Reformate is an intermediate stage in the production of gasoline and is colorless, flammable and toxic to marine life. It is still unclear how much of the product has leaked into the water, officials said. Eyewitnesses said they could see an oily sheen on the water and the smell was very strong. (MORE: Gas leak caused explosion that left 1 dead, 15 injured in North Carolina) ""We know the air is coming this way. The flow is coming this way. We are definitely going to monitor everything,"" Mayor Jeff Wagner, of Pasadena, Texas told KTRK. One of the barges capsized, while the other was severely damaged, according to the Coast Guard. Video from on scene showed one barge nearly sliced in half as a result of the collision. There were no reported injuries. Air Station Houston sent a helicopter and ship to assess the situation, according to the USCG. ""It's a light chemical and it floats on the water, which allows it to evaporate,"" Galveston Bay Foundation CEO Bob Stokes told KTRK. ""Unlike other chemicals, it doesn't sink to the bottom, but it still poses risks to marine life."" (MORE: New video shows gas blast that killed 1 in North Carolina) Houston's Department of Health said in a statement that due to wind conditions it did not expect any adverse effects in the city itself. The Coast Guard said late Friday of the air monitoring that ""if any readings above actionable levels are detected, advisories will be provided to local emergency operations centers."" There have been no evacuation orders given. The tanker was identified as the Genesis River, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carrier. The shipping channel was closed in the area of the accident.",legal arguments,Reuters,center

William Gray III signs go up at 30th Street Station,"As part of a long-planned renaming process It's been nearly five years, but officials are finally taking concrete steps toward renaming 30th Street Station in honor of late Congressman William H. Gray III. Last week, the first exterior sign bearing Gray's name was erected outside the station, with another sign to follow at the 30th Street entrance in the coming weeks, according to a statement from the William H. Gray Memorial Foundation. Amtrak will also make space for a statue of Gray, along with a memorial plaque. ""Those who visit and work at Gray 30th Street Station will have the opportunity to remember, or learn for the first time, the gift of Gray's service to our city, our nation and the world,"" Congressman Dwight Evans said in a statement. The plan to rename the station has been in effect for years, ever since a legislation calling for the new name was passed in 2014. But Amtrak didn't make any moves to change the name of the station until three years later, when state and city officials met in front of the station to pressure Amtrak to put the legislation into action. Amtrak responded shortly after, saying they were planning to work with Gray's family to think of the best ways to honor the late congressman. This week marks the sixth anniversary of Gray's death. Gray served as a U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 2nd congressional district from 1979 to 1991. He later became president and chief executive officer of the United Negro College Fund and raised over $1.58 billion for the organization, according to the Philadelphia Tribune.

venezuelans rush to peru before new requirements take effect,"AGUAS VERDES, Peru (AP)   Tired and thirsty, Betania Ramírez crossed into Peru on Friday with her 1-year-old girl in her arms and her 8-year-old boy beside her. Ramírez has no friends or relatives in Peru, and some of her luggage was stolen as she crossed two countries in cargo trucks and on foot from her home in western Venezuela. But as she finished the latest leg of her 1,500-mile (2,414-kilometer) journey, she was grateful she had made it to her destination on time - just hours before Peru started imposing stricter entry requirements on Venezuelan migrants and refugees. ""We are now in God's hands,"" Ramirez said, after passing through a border post in the region of Tumbes. ""We walked down country roads, we slept on the streets, we got robbed, but thankfully I did not get sexually assaulted."" With its relatively stable economy and flexible immigration laws, Peru has become a main destination for millions of Venezuelans escaping hyperinflation, medical shortages and political repression at home. But on Saturday, the South American nation will begin demanding passports and visas from Venezuelan migrants   requirements that many will not be able to meet. The new demands have prompted thousands of poor migrants like Ramírez to make a desperate dash for the Peruvian border, where they can still enter before the weekend begins by presenting national ID cards. On Thursday, the U.N.'s refugee agency said 5,400 Venezuelans entered Peru through the Tumbes crossing   almost three times the daily average. The agency was ""supporting and complementing the efforts of Peruvian authorities as we face the largest number of Venezuelan people coming to Peru so far,"" said UNHCR Information Officer Regina de la Portilla. But at daybreak on Friday, hundreds were already standing in new lines outside the border post or sleeping on the sidewalk as they waited for immigration officials to check their IDs. ""My daughter came to Peru a year ago, and she sent for me,"" said Leyda Murillo, an elderly migrant who was waiting in the queue. ""You can't find medicines in Venezuela, and people are dying, that's why I decided to leave my country."" Many more migrants were still on their way to the Peruvian border, making one last push through Colombia and Ecuador to arrive before the requirements were implemented. Marianni Luzardo, a mother of two, was in the Ecuadorean city of Tulcan on Thursday, which is some 500 miles (805 kilometers) away from Peru's northern border. She said it took her 16 hours to cross the Colombian-Ecuador border due to the large numbers of Venezuelans heading south. ""In Venezuela it is almost impossible to get a passport,"" Luzardo said. ""We need to get to Peru soon."" According to Peruvian authorities, more than 820,000 Venezuelans have settled in Peru since 2016 of which 270,000 have sought refugee status. Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra has said that the new entry requirements will make immigration ""safer and more orderly"" and that the large influx of Venezuelan immigrants was making it harder for Peruvians to find jobs. But human rights groups in the country have criticized the move, describing it as an attempt to lessen the numbers of needy people who are entering the country. In a letter published earlier this week, Miguel Cabrejos, the president of Peru's Catholic Bishops Conference, warned that the requirements ""present an imminent danger"" to migrants who might be tempted to enter the country illegally. Meanwhile, Amnesty International said they will not be enough to stop desperate people from trying to cross the border, noting that passports were prohibitively expensive and take months to process in Venezuela. A poll conducted in the Peruvian capital of Lima in April found that two-thirds of residents had a negative perception of Venezuelan migrants. But that idea has been strongly disputed by Venezuelans, some of whom have opened their own businesses. ""Venezuelans here work very hard,"" said Jorge Macchia, a street vendor who sells empanadas in the streets of Lima and noted that his family has been affected by new requirements. ""My wife and my two daughters are on their way to Peru,"" he said. ""But I'm not sure if they will make it on time.""",politics,ProPublica,center
Seven climbers and their guide missing in Indian Himalayas,"A search is underway for seven climbers -- four Britons, two Americans and an Australian -- and their Indian liaison officer, who went missing a week ago during an expedition in the Indian Himalayas , local authorities say. The group was attempting to scale Nanda Devi East, one of the highest and most difficult to climb peaks in India at just over 24,000 feet (7,400 meters) tall, local Uttarakhand District Magistrate, Vijay Kumar Jogdande, told CNN. The missing eight were part of a larger team of 12 who set off from the village of Munsiyari on May 13. But 12 days later, on May 25, only four of the group returned to base camp, said Uttarakhand's Senior District Official, R.D. Paliwal. The entire group was supposed to reach its base camp on May 26, according to Jogdande. The base camp is located at 19,685 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level. The company which arranged the expedition, Himalayan Run & Trek, waited a few days after the remaining members of the team failed to arrive before alerting authorities of their disappearance on May 31, Jogdande said. The Indian liaison officer who is among the missing is from the Indian Mountaineering foundation, based in New Delhi. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was in contact with Indian authorities following reports that the climbers were missing. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also said it was ""providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian that may be among a group of trekkers missing in the Nanda Devi area of India."" Three search teams have now reached the first base camp, which is 25 kilometers below the peak. Another team, equipped with medical and civil supplies, is also on its way. A military aircraft is expected to be sent tomorrow to help with the rescue effort. It is unclear whether the climbers went missing during their ascent or descent, or the cause of their disappearance. It follows the deaths of 11 climbers on Mount Everest this year, amid extraordinary images of queues of people waiting to get to the summit, prompting fresh concerns over the increased commercialization of mountaineering expeditions.",crime,CNN,left
"Judge releases court details that show speed, scope of Mueller investigation following CNN request","At the request of CNN , a federal judge in Washington on Monday released about 230 pages of data from the court showing new details about the scope and speed of Robert Mueller's investigation. The pages largely show limited new details about Mueller's work, such as the redacted case names and dates for his 499 search warrants and 200 communications data requests. Mueller began getting permission for searches in early July 2017, not even two months following his appointment as special counsel, the documents show. His office did the bulk of its searches throughout 2018, conducting only a few searches this year, when the investigation was wrapping up. Ultimately, Mueller was asking the court for access to thousands of devices and records in a grand jury investigation, according to the documents released by DC District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell. The documents now may act as a rough road map of how Mueller conducted his investigation. Almost all of the hundreds of search and seizure cases revealed Monday are still under seal. Yet the lists still confirm that Mueller and the FBI gave extensive information about the special counsel's work to the court system -- and particularly to Howell. Names and addresses are either redacted or not used throughout the lists -- with redactions made because of ongoing investigations, the Justice Department said. The 13 requests Mueller's team made to foreign governments for assistance in its investigation are not included in the lists, because they were not processed through the US federal courts. He sought emails and account data from across the web -- LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Apple and Skype, with some of the searches targeting dozens of social media accounts. Mueller in 2018 indicted Russians for spreading propaganda online to American voters largely through Facebook and Twitter, and that case appears to relate to at least some of the searches. Paul Manafort's case also appears to relate to other court applications revealed Monday, like Mueller's seizure of funds in banks named in the Manafort matter in October 2017.

"president donald trump suggests busing is just a way ""to get people to schools""","President Donald Trump on Saturday appeared to confuse a Civil Rights-era practice of school integration referred to as ""busing"" with the use of buses as a general mode of transportation for students. The president took questions from the media on Saturday following this week's Group of 20 (G-20) Summit in Osaka, Japan. In response to a question from NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker about the use of court-ordered busing to integrate school districts in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, Trump did not comment on the policy but instead observed that ""there aren't that many ways you're going to get people to schools."" Busing worked its way into the news this week, as leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has had to face questions about his previous opposition to the practice. In the second day of Democratic primary debates on Thursday, Senator Kamala Harris and the former vice president wrangled over Biden's efforts to curb federal support for busing as a senator in the 1970s, while Harris said she benefited from the practice as a schoolgirl in California the late 1960s. Biden said that while he supported busing to desegregate racially homogenous school districts, he opposed mandates from the federal government requiring the practice. Harris countered that federal intervention is often the only way to ensure recalcitrant local governments comply with civil rights law. The president's remarks received near-instantaneous scorn, with some questioning whether he even understood what the practice of desegregation busing was. Lawyer George Conway, husband to senior Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, mocked the president: ""everyone said Trump was so smart because he could tell the busing wasn't good enough and that no one was a better judge of busing than Trump."" Historian Kevin Kruse compared Trump's contribution to the busing discussion as tantamount to singing ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."" Atlantic writer Adam Serwer said that the comments suggested ""Trump thinks busing refers to literally how children get to school, not to the school integration policy Biden and Harris were [arguing] about."" While busing has widely been phased out as a standard method of school reintegration, many school districts across America have remained largely homogenous in their students' racial makeup. According to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center, nearly two-thirds of public school students in the United States attend schools where 50 percent or more of the student body is composed of the same race. The survey found that since 1995, black students have become slightly less isolated from students of other racial groups, while Hispanic students grew more isolated. Whites comprise the largest share of public school students who attend racially homogenous schools. Nearly 82 percent of white students attend schools where more than half of the student body is also white, according to the survey. Trump had evaded an earlier question from ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl about federally mandated busing, pivoting quickly to an attack on his 2020 Democratic opponents. ""Well, first of all, before I get into that, I thought that [Harris] was given too much credit,"" Trump assessed. ""[Biden] didn't do well, certainly. And maybe the facts weren't necessarily on his side."" Alluding to the busing issue at the center of Karl's question, Trump said: ""I will tell you in about four weeks."" ""Because we're coming out with a certain policy that's going to be very interesting and very surprising, I think, to a lot of people,"" he claimed. It is unclear what policy the president was referring to in his response. The apparent busing gaffe came on the same day that Trump appeared to misunderstand the term ""western liberalism."" When asked about this topic   the predominant political philosophy in the West   the president's response seemed to be about the liberal leanings of politicians in America's western states like California.

Magician inspired by Houdini drowned after being lowered into river in chains,"An Indian magician inspired by Harry Houdini is dead after he failed to reappear when he was tied with ropes, locked in chains and dropped into a river. Chanchal Lahiri, whose stage name was Jadugar Mandrake, had not been seen since Sunday afternoon, when he was lowered into the Hooghly River, which branches off the Ganges, river traffic police officer Syed Waquar Raza told Agence France-Presse Monday. Lahiri's body was found later Monday less than a mile from where he performed the stunt, the BBC and Guardian reported. Raza also told the Times of India that police had given Lahiri permission to perform a stunt but that the magician said it would be performed on a boat and did not mention water. ""However, he did vaguely mention an 'extra act,' which he did not clarify,"" Raza said. According to the BBC , Lahiri, in his 40s, was shackled with six locks and lowered into the river from a boat in Kolkata. Before he attempted the trick, Lahiri, dressed in a yellow and red costume, turned to a crowd that had gathered to watch his performance. ""If I can open it up, then it will be magic, but if I can't, it will be tragic,"" he said, according to the Guardian . Famed illusionist Harry Houidini performed a version of the trick more than 100 years ago when he escaped from a box tossed into New York's East River. Lahiri also had done the stunt at least a dozen times, Sumit Kharbanda, president of the Indian Brotherhood of Magicians, told the Guardian. More than 20 years ago, he performed the same trick while locked in a glass box and lowered into the same river, Lahiri told the AFP. He said he was attempting the stunt again to ""revive interest in magic.""

Parolee gets 55 years to life behind bars for shootout with gang detective,"A 34-year-old man identified by police as a documented gang member was sentenced to 55 years to life in state prison Monday for a 2016 shootout with police that injured a Santa Ana gang detective. An Orange County Superior Court jury in March found Carlos Michael Rodriguez guilty of attempted murder on an officer, assault with a semi-automatic rifle, possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of heroin and methamphetamine with an intent to sell, all felonies, according to Santa Ana police and court records. ""By way of this sentencing the message is clear,"" Santa Ana Police Chief David Valentin said in a prepared statement. ""As a community we cannot tolerate continued violence against anyone, especially violent acts committed against our uniformed police officers."" Rodriguez had been released from prison shortly before the Feb. 17, 2016, shooting after serving an eight-year sentence for assaulting a police officer, authorities said. Authorities said Rodriguez opened fire at gang detectives who had tried to stop him as they were on patrol in the 2700 block of West McFadden Avenue. At the time, the area was populated by several gangs who had been competing for territory, according to a district attorney report on the shooting . A bullet grazed then-Det. Matthew Lemmon's head, police said. Lemmon has since been promoted to corporal. ""Right when I see him … he fires at me … shoots directly at my head,"" Lemmon told investigators at the time. Lemmon turned his head and ducked. He felt pressure on his head but wasn't sure whether he had been hit at the time, according to the report. He fired back, telling investigators that he was ""just trying to stay alive,"" the report states. Rodriguez was struck in the upper and lower torso. He was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment. Lemmon also was treated and released from a hospital, police said. hannah.fry@latimes.com Twitter: @Hannahnfry",crime,Los Angeles Times,left

Nipsey Hussle killing: LAPD to investigate why a desk officer turned away a witness,"The Los Angeles Police Department opened an internal affairs investigation to determine why a desk officer turned away the woman who drove the getaway car after her passenger fatally shot rapper Nipsey Hussle. The Internal Affairs Group is investigating a desk officer's response at the 77th Street station in April, said Josh Rubenstein, the LAPD's chief spokesman. Investigators will interview witnesses and review any recordings from body cameras worn by desk officers, he said. ""Early indications"" show that miscommunication led to the witness being turned away, he added. ""We want to make sure all of policies and procedures were followed,"" Rubenstein said, declining to comment further. The investigation comes after the Los Angeles Times reported last week that an officer turned the woman away after she spotted her car and license plate on the news. ""Oh my God,"" she told her mom, according to her May testimony before a grand jury . ""My car is on here and everything and I didn't do anything. I didn't know this boy was gonna do this."" Right away, her mom called the police, who relayed that detectives would be in at 6 a.m. The next morning, they decided, they went to the station to tell police the truth. But when she showed up at the 77th Street station and told a front desk officer that she wanted to talk to someone because her car was linked to a murder, she testified, an officer turned her away. ""One of the police officers is like, 'Well, don't worry about it,' you know, 'Don't listen to the news,'"" the woman testified. ""My mom said, 'Well, she needs to talk to somebody.' But he said, 'Don't worry about it.' So we just left."" The woman did get in touch with detectives later that morning. But her testimony raises questions about why she apparently wasn't taken seriously when she first tried to report what she knew about a shooting that sparked worldwide headlines and days of memorials and grieving far beyond Hussle's South L.A. neighborhood. Two other people were wounded. An LAPD detective corroborated the woman's account when questioned by a prosecutor during the grand jury hearing, saying the woman showed up at 7 a.m. to ""basically either turn herself in or to find out why her vehicle was on   or to speak with detectives regarding her vehicle being on the news,"" the transcripts show.",legal arguments,Los Angeles Times,left
"Help pouring in to Trona, Calif., after quakes, but officials say recovery will take time","LOS ANGELES - Less than a week after twin earthquakes rocked the core of the tiny San Bernardino County town of Trona, Ronnie Tolbert walked out of a community meeting and got straight to work. The longtime resident helped an Arizona man unload a van full of supplies, which would be delivered to a local church for distribution. Tolbert, 60, said she's in awe of the help coming from out of state to Trona, a place few had heard of before last week's major quakes. What's less surprising, she said, is the goodwill that has come from within the small town of about 1,800 people. Since the first earthquake, measuring magnitude 6.4, struck on July 4, neighbors have spent long hours helping one another as resources from outside communities and local officials have trickled in. On Wednesday morning, about 900 residents gathered at Trona High School for a community meeting convened by local officials - three days after a similar meeting in nearby Ridgecrest. Though it took a few days for additional help to arrive, officials and volunteers are now out in full force, Tolbert said. Representatives from the California Department of Emergency Services, the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, the county Land Use Department, the Red Cross and other agencies were at the 10 a.m. meeting to hear locals' concerns, said Robert Lovingood, chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors. A full recovery, though, will take more time. ""I certainly think it's going to be a while,"" Lovingood said. ""We're going to continue until everything is back and functioning."" County officials have brought portable showers and bathrooms to Trona, established a shuttle service between the town and Ridgecrest, opened commodity distribution centers and made counselors available at the local high school. Federal and state funding is beginning to roll in. Power was restored - again - a day after Friday's 7.1 quake, residents said. Water just came back on Wednesday morning. ""It's steamrolling to where we're starting to get a lot more resources we need to help rebuild,"" said resident Jonathan Schmid, 36, who works at the Searles Valley Mineral Plant. Schmid has become an informal liaison between his neighbors and county officials. He wakes up daily at 6 a.m. to unload and distribute donations and puts his head to rest after midnight, he said. ""It's still hectic,"" he said. ""We take care of our own."" At the town hall, residents expressed concern for Trona's elderly and disabled and their medical needs, Schmid said. And because the town lies on the border of Inyo and San Bernardino counties, he's worried not everyone is getting the same level of attention. Tolbert said many residents are still focused on cleanup and getting their homes cleared by safety officials. Many houses have been red-tagged - declared unsafe to inhabit - and residents have resorted to sleeping in their yards. Tolbert herself sleeps on mattresses on her driveway after her home was severely damaged. Those who can get into their homes find shelter under tables or away from walls. Some have left the town entirely. Still, Tolbert said the experience has brought everyone closer. ""I now know things about my town I did not know,"" she said. ""I am a more aware neighbor, honest to God."" Visit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com",environmental issues,Los Angeles Times,left
career criminal charged in shooting death of 2-year-old st. paul boy,"Nearly three years to the day that a 2-year-old St. Paul boy was fatally shot at a North Minneapolis intersection, prosecutors have charged the man they suspect pulled the trigger. Chris Maurice Welch, a 34-year-old Lexington, Minn., man currently serving a lengthy prison term for a felony weapons conviction, was charged with second-degree murder in Hennepin County District Court Monday for the death of 2-year-old Le'Vonte King Jason Jones. Welch was initially arrested a couple weeks after the July 8, 2016, shooting that resulted in young Le'Vonte's death, but was released for lack of evidence. A criminal complaint this week detailed the additional evidence prosecutors suspect they need: a series of witness statements pointing toward Welch as the man who pulled up next to the van Le'Vonte was riding in and began shooting. Le'Vonte's family appeared in the audience of a news conference held by police and prosecutors Monday, and   while noting that it had taken some time   thanked law enforcement for their efforts. ""Today feels like the beginning of what justice could look like,"" said Pastor Danny Givens, who accompanied the family. Le'Vonte's mother, LeShae Jones, said the ordeal has been rough but the charges ""make me feel like I got some justice."" Beside her stood Le'Vonte's sister, Melia, who as a 15-month-old infant sat next to Le'Vonte when he was shot. She was shot in the leg herself. Jones said the girl is currently in physical therapy for her injury. Jones's boyfriend, Melvonte Peterson, was driving the van, and returned fire before driving to a nearby hospital. He was also charged with murder for Le'Vonte's death, but a judge tossed those charges years ago, saying they ""defied common sense;"" instead, Peterson pleaded guilty to a weapons charge. While listing no physical evidence, the criminal complaint against Welch details seven witnesses who point to him as the driver of the Chevrolet Impala that pulled up next to Peterson's minivan. Only one of the seven allegedly witnessed the shooting, telling police they were present in the Impala at the time. Several others said they had seen Welch driving the Impala immediately before or after the shooting, and two said Welch told them afterward about being in a shooting and needing more bullets. One witness said Welch admitted to shooting Peterson and showed him the gun. The same witness said Peterson had stolen from Welch, but Welch said ""he didn't' mean to shoot a kid."" RELATED: Rosario: Mike Freeman returns to work   unbowed and ready for business The complaint also states that since Welch has been incarcerated, ""multiple witnesses"" approached law enforcement officials to state that Welch admitted to the shooting. It is unclear whether any of the seven listed individually in the complaint are jailhouse informants. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Monday that he didn't anticipate charging anyone else in the shooting. Related Articles Two drug users.

horses in weld county test positive for vesicular stomatitis,"BROOMFIELD, Colo.   Two horses in Weld County tested positive July 3 for vesicular stomatitis. Two other states, New Mexico and Texas, reported confirmed cases this year, according to a news release from the Colorado Department of Agriculture. The horses, which live in two different parts of Weld County, have been placed under quarantine. Vesicular stomatitis primarily affects horses and cattle, and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas, according to the release. The transmission process is not completely understood, but black flies, sand flies, and biting midges could be carriers. Signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats, and coronary bands. According to the release, excessive salivation is often the first sign of disease, along with a reluctance to eat or drink. Lameness and weight loss may follow. Although humans can become infected when handling the affected animals, it rarely occurs. To avoid human exposure, people should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals. Colorado State Veterinarian Keith Roehr completed the initial investigation into the cases. ""Vesicular stomatitis can be painful for animals and costly to their owners,"" Roehr said, in the release. ""The virus typically causes oral blisters and sores that can be painful causing difficulty in eating and drinking."" Insects were likely carrying the disease, and mitigation efforts are underway to reduce the chance the virus will spread, according to the release. The horses will be under quarantine until at least 14 days after the onset of lesions. No United States Department of Agriculture-approved vaccines exist for vesicular stomatitis. The Weld County epidemiological investigation indicates an incursion of VSV-infected insect vectors is the likely source of infection. Biosecurity measures and vector mitigation have been instituted on both locations to reduce the potential spread of the virus. The animals are being monitored daily and the index premises will remain under state quarantine until at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises. There are no USDA approved vaccines for VSV. The following are tips for livestock owners from the Colorado Department of Agriculture: Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease. Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools or health care equipment from other herds. Colorado veterinarians and livestock owners should contact the state of destination when moving livestock interstate to ensure that all import requirements are met. Contact information for all state veterinarian offices is listed here . Colorado fairs, livestock exhibitions, and rodeos may institute new entry requirements based on the extent and severity of the current VS outbreak. Certificates of veterinary inspection issued within 2-5 days prior to an event can be beneficial in reducing risks. Be sure to stay informed of any new livestock event requirements. See the Vesicular Stomatitis Guidelines for Shows and Fairs. Important Points for Veterinarians Report any vesicular disease to the State Veterinarian's Office in Colorado at 303-869-9130.

Duncan Hunter's lawyers seek to block evidence of extramarital affairs in corruption case,"Lawyers for embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter , R-Calif., are asking a federal judge to block the government from introducing evidence that he charged his campaign thousands of dollars to finance extramarital relationships with several women. The lawyers argued in an eight-page document filed Friday that federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence not pertinent to the corruption charges against Hunter. ""Evidence of Mr. Hunter's 'intimate affairs' is not directly relevant to the ultimate issue in this case, whether Mr. Hunter knowingly converted campaign funds to his personal use,"" the motion said. Politico reported that defense attorneys also chastised federal prosecutors for airing Duncan's infidelities in public through a motion filed Monday asking for jurors to hear testimony about the relationships. ""However unpopular the notion of a married man mixing business with pleasure, the government cannot simply dismiss the reality that Mr. Hunter's relationships with [the women] often served an overtly political purpose that would not have existed irrespective of his occupation,"" they wrote. Hunter -- an Iraq War veteran -- is scheduled to go on trial for allegedly spending more than $250,000 in campaign funds on vacations, meals, hotel stays and bills. He also allegedly charged the campaign thousands of dollars for drinks, Uber rides and airfare during trysts with various women, who were lobbyists and congressional aides. Hunter's defense team said the expenses listed by prosecutors were ""incurred in connection with a legitimate political activity."" ""In its quest to highlight the intimate nature of these relationships, the government fails to meaningfully consider the fact that, just as with Mr. Hunter's platonic relationships, his friendships often blur the line between personal and professional, which is a widespread occurrence in modern politics,"" the lawyers said. Hunter has denied any wrongdoing and has said his wife, Margaret Hunter , handled the family's finances and served as his campaign manager. ""Mr. Hunter's military service is relevant to show he left his family's financial responsibilities to his wife while on deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan, and this arrangement continued throughout the period of the indictment,"" defense lawyers wrote.

My body completely went into a state of shock."" The New York Post reported on Patricia's medically-induced coma earlier in June after she reportedly collapsed on the street in Brandon, Florida. After being rushed to Brandon Regional Hospital, she was treated for pneumonia and serious complications. ""I had a breakdown in my body. My whole system just collapsed,"" she said. The New York Post also reported that her lungs were weak and filled with fluid, and when doctors were unable to drain it Patricia went into cardiac arrest.

"'Mobster' is shot to death while waiting for coffee at a McDonald's drive thru, three months after his son was wounded in a failed hit","Video by FOX News A reputed mobster was shot to death at a McDonald's drive-thru while waiting for a cup of coffee - three months after his son was gunned down in failed hit. Sylvester Zottola was blasted once in the head, then four times in the chest and shoulder while sitting in his car outside the fast food restaurant in New York at around 4.45 pm yesterday, police told the New York Post . The 71-year-old, whose son was injured during an attempted murder three months ago, had reportedly ordered a coffee at the drive-thru in the Bronx when his car was boxed in and gunman opened fire. He was pronounced dead at the scene and was found slumped in his maroon SUV with bullet holes in the driver's side window by passers-by and McDonald's customers. Witness Juan Bravo told the New York Times he thought that a woman and a baby were in the car, but added that both seemed to not have been injured during the shooting. His killer was said to have fled in a gray vehicle, according to police. Sylvester, who is a reported Bonanno crime family associate, was said to have been attacked three times in the past year by rival gangsters. In September he was hit with a bat near his home in the Bronx, then two months later a gunman forced him into a car, then in December he walked in on burglars ransacking his home. One of the burglars pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the neck, leaving him in a critical condition in hospital. He was also arrested earlier this year for firing at a man who pulled a gun on him outside his home. His 41-year-old son, Salvatore Zottola, was injured when a gunman opened fire multiple times on him outside his Bronx home in July, in what is thought to be an attack aimed at his father. Zottola is said to have forged a career supplying and servicing Joker Poker machines to mob-controlled gambling dens in the the 1990s and early 2000s. He was an associate of Vincent Basciano, who ran the Bonanno crime family in the early 2000s. Armenian and Russian mobsters are said to have been trying to move into the gangster's turf. Police say no arrests had been made in the relation to the suspected gangland murder of Zottola.",crime,New York Post,right
"Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders call for climate change emergency mobilization, seeks a re-do of failed Green New Deal","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce Tuesday a resolution declaring a climate change emergency, a move that comes after the Green New Deal failed to take off the ground earlier this year. The resolution, also co-sponsored by Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer, will call for a wide-scale mobilization to combat the emergency and restore the climate ""for future generations."" GREEN NEW DEAL FAILS SENATE TEST VOTE AS DOZENS OF DEMOCRATS VOTE 'PRESENT' ""The global warming caused by human activities,"" claims the draft resolution, according to the Mother Jones magazine, ""has resulted in a climate emergency that … demands a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale."" Ocasio-Cortez and Blumenauer, meanwhile, also wrote to fellow members of Congress urging them to declare climate change an emergency in a bid to ""swiftly mobilize federal resources in response."" The resolution, according to the outlet, details how climate change impacts public health and national security of the U.S., though it doesn't make any exact recommendations how to address the so-called emergency. The latest declaration comes after Ocasio-Cortez's signature Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic proposal for dealing with climate change, failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate back in March, with 42 Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voting ""present."" OCASIO-CORTEZ ASSAILS BIDEN'S 'MIDDLE GROUND' CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN, SAYS IT'S 'DEALBREAKER' Both the New York Democrat and her colleagues decried Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's move to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote, saying the Republicans purposely rushed the vote while McConnell only wanted Democrats to go on record to support the sweeping proposal that he himself called ""a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy."" The Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. Republicans have railed against the proposal, saying it would devastate the economy and trigger massive tax increases. It remains unclear how the new resolution differs from the Green New Deal, though a spokesperson for Sanders told the magazine that unlike President Trump's emergencies, the climate change declaration warrants the use of emergency powers.

"Biologist on uptick in alligator attacks, incident involving corpse: 'The populations have exploded'","A surge in alligator attacks in Florida has left residents concerned, and biologist Jeff Corwin reminded ""Fox & Friends"" viewers that the formally endangered beasts are still dangerous predators. Two people were bitten by alligators in Florida last month, including a five-year-old girl who was forced to get 11 stitches after the attack. In St. Petersberg, a group of about 10 alligators were seen eating the ""badly decomposed"" body of a 16-year-old boy on Thursday. During a Monday morning appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" Corwin said it's ""very, very rare"" that an alligator would kill a living person and eat their remains, and that the instance in St. Petersburg likely happened after the person was already dead. However, both the human and alligator population is constantly increasing in Florida, and the tendency for people to forget their true nature leads to unfortunate mishaps. FLORIDA MAN DESCRIBES 'SHOCKING ALLIGATOR ATTACK ON 5-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER IN LAKE ""The truth is, is alligator populations have exploded,"" Corwin said. ""What you need to keep in mind is that alligators just a few decades ago were critically endangered. They are one of our greatest conservation success stories, to the point now they are no longer endangered."" As alligators increase in numbers, so is the state's population, Corwin continued, claiming that 3,000 people move to the southern state each month. ""If there is a body of water in Florida, if there is a pond, a swamp, a lagoon, even a swimming pool, it's very likely there is an alligator nearby,"" he said. ""We both share this ecosystem together, and that is where you get situations like this."" FLORIDA ALLIGATOR ATTACK LEAVES WOMAN WITH SIGNIFICANT BITE INJURIES, OFFICIALS SAY An additional concern is that people seem to have lost sight of how dangerous alligators can be, and have begun to feed them and marvel at their size. As alligators become more exposed to humans, they become less fearful of them, Corwin said, and may even rely on them for food. ""People need to recognize is that these are powerful, powerful creatures,"" Corwin added.

Apollo 11 flight plan and NASA memo discussing Neil Armstrong's first words on the Moon up for auction,"A preliminary flight plan and a NASA memo discussing Neil Armstrong's historic first words on the Moon are among a host of artifacts from the historic Apollo 11 mission that are up for auction next month. The artifacts are part of an auction of Neil Armstrong's personal collection and archive that will be held from July 12 to 18 by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions. The artifacts in the auction are from the Armstrong Family Collection. A three-sheet internal NASA memo discusses the issue of whether Armstrong should be coached on what to say during his famous first steps on the lunar surface. In the letter, Julian Scheer, NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs, argues that the Apollo 11 commander should not be coached. ""The truest emotion at the historic moment is what the explorer feels within himself not for the astronauts be coached before they leave or to carry a prepared text in their hip pockets,"" he wrote. ""There may be some who are concerned that some dramatic utterance may not be emitted by the first astronaut who touches the lunar surface. I don't share that concern,"" Scheer adds. ""Others believe a poet ought to go the Moon. Columbus wasn't a poet and he didn't have a prepared text, but his words were pretty dramatic to me. When he saw the Canary Islands he wrote, 'I landed and saw people running around naked, some very green trees, much water, and many fruits'."" In the memo, Scheer also cites the words of Capt. James Cook, Meriweather Lewis and polar explorer Robert Peary. It has a pre-sale estimate of $15,000. July 20, 1969, marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Armstrong's personal copy of the Apollo 11 preliminary flight plan will also be auctioned next month. The plan consists of 134 pages of crew activities, planned minute by minute, according to Heritage Auctions. The flight plan has a pre-sale estimate of $6,000. Other items in the auction include an Apollo-era flight suit that was worn by Armstrong, a piece of the Apollo 11 heatshield, and even a toy teddy bear from the moonwalker's childhood. The items have pre-sale estimates of $40,000, $8,000 and $3,000, respectively. ""Armstrong's archive comprises the behind-the-scenes treasures that made the Apollo 11 crew's brave journey a success,"" said Greg Rohan, president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. ""It literally makes this monumentally historical event come alive."" Pre-auction bidding opened Thursday. The historic mission continues to be a source of fascination.

"Chris Wallace challenges Giuliani over Trump's 'no obstruction' claim: 'Mayor, that's not true'","Fox News anchor Chris Wallace on Sunday challenged President Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, over Trump's claim that there is now proof he did not obstruct justice in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. ""But, mayor, that's not true,"" Wallace said on ""Fox News Sunday. ""The Mueller report makes it clear, especially on the issue of obstruction, that he's leaving it to Congress."" ""I agree with that,"" Giuliani interjected. Wallace replied ""good,"" before noting a passage in special counsel Robert Mueller's report that he said ""invites"" Congress to look into the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice. ""And the president, in terms of Congress, hasn't been exonerated at all on the issue of the obstruction,"" Wallace said. Trump made the ""no obstruction"" claim on Sunday morning in a tweet , as well as in a speech Thursday before the report dropped. He has also claimed ""total exoneration"" from Mueller, a word that is not used in the report. But Giuliani on Sunday said that a person under investigation never gets exonerated. ""You do not apply a standard of exoneration to anyone,"" Giuliani contended, calling the report infected and ""warped."" ""Whether it's a president, an impeachment. You can't exonerate. Exoneration means proving a negative."" The comments led to a back-and-forth between Wallace and Giuliani about the reasons why Mueller advised that the obstruction decision to be taken up by Congress. ""The issue here is did the president obstruct justice or not,"" Wallace said, before pointing to an example included in Mueller's report about Trump in 2017 directing former White House counsel Don McGahn to dismiss Mueller. McGahn refused to follow through on the request, according to Mueller. ""Had he done it, it would not have been obstruction of justice because there were very good reasons to fire Mueller,"" Giuliani responded , arguing that Mueller hired a staff that ""had people that I would find very, very questionable as people that should be investigating Donald Trump."" The exchange comes just days after the Justice Department released a redacted version of Mueller's report into Russian interference and Trump. Mueller did not uncover evidence to conclude that collusion occurred.

"Oregon deputies pull out 57 electric scooters, bikes out of Portland river","This is not your average ""catch of the day."" A sheriff's office in Oregon recently disclosed it hauled dozens of electric scooters and bicycles out of a major river in Portland.

ELECTRIC SCOOTERS BEING DUMPED IN CALIFORNIA LAKE, AS POPULARITY EXPLODES ""The team had to quit early because they needed a bigger boat!"" the sheriff's office said . Officials told FOX12 the dive team found 15 scooters in May during a training exercise before dredging up dozens more this week. The scooter brands included Razor, Lime and Bird. The dive team used the scooter recovery as a training exercise since the river bottom has limited visibility so everything has to be found by touch. As scooter popularity has exploded in recent years, so have environmental concerns over the electric batteries impacting marine life. Sgt.

Trump promises not to use Kim Jong Un's family members as intel assets,"President Donald Trump promised Tuesday not to use Kim Jong Un's family members as intelligence assets, and reassured the North Korean dictator of his commitment to detente.

A Wall Street Journal story entitled ""North Korean Leader's Slain Half Brother Was A CIA Source"" claims a ""person knowledgeable about the matter"" confirmed he was feeding intelligence to American officials. Trump referred to his current relationship with Kim during an exchange with reporters outside Marine One Tuesday, saying he believes the two still have a strong relationship. ""I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong Un,"" he said. Speaking to the press pool, Trump said, ""I think the relationship is very well, but I appreciated the letter. I saw the information about the CIA with regard to his brother or half brother, and I would tell him that would not happen under my auspices. I wouldn't let that happen under my auspices."" Kim Jong Nam was murdered in February of 2017 when two women smudged his face with VX nerve agent at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. In March, the Malaysian attorney general dropped the murder charge against Siti Aisyah, following high-level lobbying from Jakarta and Doan Thi Huong was released in May. The two women have also been accused of conspiring with four North Koreans who prosecutors said have left the country, AP reported. The CIA declined to comment to Fox News. Trump has often spoken positively about Kim , despite concerns over North Korea's potential nuclear program and threats of violent retaliation against the United States.

North Carolina man finds megalodon shark tooth buried on beach: 'I'll probably never find another one',"A North Carolina man made a rare prehistoric find last week while taking a stroll along a beach. Harvey Wall was out with his family on the shores of Ocean Isle Beach on June 28 when he saw something sticking out of the sand. He dug it out and discovered a nearly 6-inch tooth of the extinct megalodon shark . He shared photos of the gray tooth and its striking black root on social media. ""I was surprised [that it was there]. We were looking for seashells and walking our dogs,"" Wall told WECT-TV . ""I could only see the black part [of the tooth] in low tide. I kicked it and it flipped over, exposing the whole tooth."" The megalodon, considered one of, if not the largest marine predator to ever live, had enormous teeth   some approaching nearly 8 inches in length. Its bite diameter measured about 9.8 feet, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . A study published in February suggests the megalodon died off around 3.6 million years ago, roughly 1 million years sooner than initially thought. It also hypothesized that competition from the great white shark contributed to the sea giant's extinction. North Carolina has become known as a hot spot for finding the giant prehistoric teeth. Marine biologist Chris Slog told WTVD-TV last year that the teeth are concentrated in ancient river beds, known as Megalodon Tooth Ledges, located about 40 miles offshore and beneath 110 feet of water. But finding a tooth so far inland, like Wall, is an unexpected surprise. In April, a middle school girl found a buried megalodon tooth at North Carolina's North Topsail Beach while on spring break. While some of the ancient teeth are auctioned off for a profit, Wall has other plans for the rare treasure, writing that he plans to donate it to the Museum of Coastal Carolina.

"Pelosi calls for Acosta to step down over Epstein plea deal, hits Trump","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Monday called on Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to step down for what she called an ""unconscionable agreement"" with Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged earlier with sex trafficking in New York City federal court. Acosta, who was a U.S. attorney in Miami back in 2008, helped Epstein secure a plea deal that resulted in an 18-month sentence. He served 13 months. The deal was criticized as lenient because he could have faced a life sentence. Pelosi said in a tweet late Monday that Acosta's agreement with Epstein was kept from his ""young victims"" and prevented them from seeking justice.

There were no federal charges. The Washington Post reported that Epstein was allowed to work from his office six days a week. The alleged victims were not told about the deal, the report said. The Miami Herald called the allegations back then ""stomach-turning."" They included allegations that the wealthy financier lured dozens of troubled girls to an estate in Palm Beach and had sex with them.

Colorado Christian cakeshop sued a third time for discrimination,"The owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop -- which won a case before the U.S. Supreme Court recently -- was sued for a third time this week. Jack Phillips, the Lakewood, Colo. bakery owner who has refused to bake cakes that violate his Christian faith , is being sued again by Autumn Scardina, a transgender woman, for refusing to bake a gender transition cake. Scardina claims it is textbook LGBT discrimination . But Phillips said she is rehashing old claims that hold no merit.

He has insisted he doesn't want to do something that goes against his faith. He said the cases against him have directly affected his family and business and he's faced death threats and harassment. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phillips last year in a case where he refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. The high court ruled the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed ""anti-religious bias"" when it filed a discrimination charge against Phillips. The commission then filed another complaint against Phillips after he refused to make Scardina a cake celebrating a gender transition. He, in turn, sued the state claiming he was being singled out for his religious beliefs. The Commission and Phillips agreed to drop their cases in March after discovery showed ""anti-religious hostility"" from the state toward the family-run bakery. Scardina decided to pursue separate litigation, which attorneys filed Wednesday in district court. ""The dignity of all citizens in our state needs to be honored. Masterpiece Cakeshop said before the Supreme Court they would serve any baked good to members of the LGBTQ community.

Police swarm home of missing Connecticut mother-of-five's estranged husband in late-night search as he remains in custody on suspicion of tampering with evidence,"Video by CBS New York Police conducted a late night search at the home of a mother-of-five's estranged husband as officer's continued to look for the missing woman. A search warrant was carried out at Fotis Dulos' home in Connecticut as the hunt for Jennifer Farber Dulos was extended last night. The 50-year-old was last seen dropping off her children at school on May 24 and her estranged husband and another woman have been arrested in connection with her disappearance. Eight German Shepherd cadaver dogs were seen sifting through trash collected in Hartford's north end since around 3pm on Monday, reportedly looking for bone fragments. On the same day detectives sought security footage from neighbors as Fotis Dulos, 51, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, 44, were arraigned on suspicion of tampering with evidence. Two people who matched the description of Fotis Dulos and Troconis were recorded on video disposing of trash bags the night of Jennifer's disappearance. And last night police were at the property of Fotis Dulos on Jefferson Crossing in Farmington executing a search warrant, according to NBC Connecticut . At least six police vehicles and several Connecticut State Police detectives were seen at the property with K9s. Fotis remains in police custody and has been ordered to have no contact with Jennifer's family or his children. Connecticut police had been searching through garbage at a Hartford trash-to-energy plant looking for evidence in the investigation. Surveillance cameras recorded a pickup similar to one owned by Fotis Dulos, appearing to stop more than 30 times along the four-mile stretch Albany Avenue in Hartford, court documents obtained by DailyMail.com state. His arrest warrant stated: 'Numerous items recovered from trash receptacles corresponding to dump locations shown on video were submitted to the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Forensic Laboratory. 'Items submitted to the DESPP lab were tested and found to contain Jennifer Dulos' blood. 'Based on the crime scene processing, investigators came to the consensus that a serious physical assault had occurred at the scene, and Jennifer Dulos was the suspected victim.' Following Monday's arraignments, court documents stated Jennifer Dulos' blood was found on clothing and other items including kitchen sponges thrown out in areas along Albany Avenue. Jennifer's blood was also found in her garage. Investigators believe Fotis Dulos and Troconis attempted to clean up the blood-stained areas. New Canaan Police Department sent out an email to Fairfield County residents Monday asking for security footage. Jennifer Dulos and her ex argued about the custody of their children and threatened to harm each other amid a two-year court battle, according to documents. A divorce filing from the missing woman said she feared her ex would harm her and said her former partner has a gun. After she went missing he asked a divorce judge for custody of their children, who he saw every other weekend. But on Monday as the father was behind bars, Gloria Farber, Jennifer's mother, filed a motion for custody in Connecticut Superior Court. The 85-year-old has kept security guards on watch outside her property where the children, aged between eight and 13, have been staying. A lawsuit claimed Fotis Dulos had borrowed money from her to pay for properties but failed to pay back $1.7million in loans. Police obtained Dulos' cell phone and records indicate that on the day Jennifer disappeared, he traveled from his home to a property his business owns around 1.30pm, home around 4.20pm, back to the property at 5.20pm and then back home once more at 5.30pm. Then at 7.10pm, the phone was tracked to Hartford, where the bloodied items were later recovered. Police said in the arrest warrant that neither Dulos nor Troconis were cooperating in their investigation at the time. Troconis' bond was set at $500,000 and she posted bail in the afternoon. She attempted to hide her face under a jacket as she left court with an ankle monitor on her leg. Dulos, whose bond was also set at $500,000, remains in custody. Fotis Dolus' mother, Kleopatra Dulos, 77, died shortly after she was run over by a family employee in a Land Rover on their driveway in Avon, Connecticut, on September 6, 2010, DailyMail.com exclusively revealed.",crime,DailyMail.com,right
Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher found not guilty on murder and attempted murder charges,"A jury found decorated Navy SEAL Edward ""Eddie"" Gallagher not guilty Tuesday on almost all charges he was facing, including murder and attempted murder, in the killing of a teenage Islamic State member in Iraq. Gallagher was accused of stabbing to death a 15-year-old ISIS fighter in 2017 and posing with the corpse for photos. As he awaited the charges to be read, Gallagher, 40, bounced lightly on his feet, appearing nervous, but dissolved into joyful tears once the verdict came through, tightly embracing his wife, Andrea, who has publicly championed him throughout the case as they both cried. Also seated in the gallery were Gallagher's attorneys, brother and parents, all of whom he exchanged hugs. ""I'm happy and I'm thankful,"" Gallagher told reporters after the verdict as he joked with his legal team that ""it's Independence Day,"" his freedom coming days before the July 4th holiday. ""Suffice to say, huge victory, huge weight off the Gallaghers, huge victory for justice,"" Gallagher's attorney Marc Mukasey said adding that his client cried ""tears of joy, emotion, freedom, absolute euphoria and proud of the process."" ""I was feeling like we're finally vindicated after being terrorized by the government that my husband fought for for 20 years,"" Andrea Gallagher said. She also said she intends to ""continue to fight for the war heroes of this country"" and hopes to see Naval Special Warfare Group 1 Commodore Capt. Matthew D. Rosenbloom resign, among other things. He faced seven criminal charges in all. Six of the most serious charges included premeditated murder, willfully discharging a firearm to endanger human life, retaliation against members of his platoon for reporting his alleged actions, obstruction of justice and the attempted murders of two noncombatants. On all of those charges, the jury in San Diego found him not guilty. Jurors did find him guilty of the seventh charge, posing for a photo with a casualty, considered the least egregious of the crimes, which carries a maximum prison sentence of four months. ""We have a sentencing to do, but the maximum sentence of what they're about to sentence him on is much less than the time that they've already had him in the brig,"" defense attorney Tim Parlatore said. ""So he is going home."" Gallagher served nine months in prison awaiting trial but was released ahead of trial proceedings at the end of May as the judge attempted to rectify alleged prosecutorial misconduct which included the unauthorized tracking of the defense's emails. Nearly a dozen members of Gallagher's platoon testified against him, revealing that nearly all the platoon members posed for photos with the dead prisoner and witnessed Gallagher read his reenlistment oath near the body, actions prosecutors said proved that Gallagher was ""proud"" of his actions. Perhaps the biggest bombshell in the case occurred on June 20 when Gallagher's colleague, Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, admitted to asphyxiating the ISIS fighter back in 2017, contrary to the testimony of at least seven other SEALs who said Gallagher stabbed the ISIS fighter after medics administered treatment to him, ultimately resulting in the teenager's death. Gallagher, who served 19 years in the Navy and earned a Bronze Star with V for Valor twice, a Meritorious Unit Commendation and a trio of Navy and Marine Corps Achievement medals, has been publicly championed by his wife and even President Trump, who previously got Gallagher removed from the brig and transferred to better custody conditions at a Navy hospital before trial.

McConnell to force vote next week on Trump border funding request,"Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is pledging to force a vote on President Trump's $4.5 billion request for emergency border money, regardless of whether or not the GOP can reach a deal with Democrats. McConnell told Fox News's ""Fox & Friends"" during an interview on Monday that he was planning to bring up a ""freestanding"" deal in an effort to force Democrats to go on the record either supporting or blocking the request for humanitarian aid legislation. ""I'm going to bring it up freestanding next week and see if they really aren't interested in dealing with this massive humanity that we have to take care of at the border,"" McConnell said. ""What's the objection? This is not about the wall but about the humanitarian crisis."" McConnell's plan to force a vote on a bill next week comes as the Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to mark up Trump's $4.5 billion request in committee on Thursday. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told reporters late last week that they were still drafting the legislation that would be taken up in his committee. Though Republicans can pass it through the panel without support from the other side of the aisle, they'll need at least seven Democrats on board to get the measure cleared through the full Senate. The White House's request includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian aid, which the administration says would be used to increase shelters and care for unaccompanied minors, in addition to processing arrivals. They've also asked for roughly $1.1 billion for other border operations like expanding the number of detention beds and providing more investigation resources. McConnell and Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee both say they want Congress to pass a bill before the end of the month, when they leave for the July 4th recess. But, so far, they haven't worked out what would be included in any agreement. Democrats say they support providing additional humanitarian aid for the U.S.-Mexico border, including shoring up a Health and Human Services (HHS) office that is responsible for unaccompanied minors detained along the border and on the verge of running out of funding. But trying to get funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or expanding the number of detention beds is a non-starter for Democrats. McConnell, on Monday, argued that Democrats were suffering from ""Trump derangement syndrome."" ""Whatever he's for they are reflectively against,"" McConnell added. ""I think it's safe to say the president is getting more cooperation out of Mexico than he is out of congressional Democrats.""",politics,Fox News,right
Washington man assaults woman days after being released from jail for raping her last year: prosecutors,"Washington authorities are hunting a convicted rapist who they believe attacked a wheelchair-bound woman just three days after getting out of jail -- where he'd been locked up for previously raping the same woman. Francisco Carranza-Ramirez, 35, was released from jail last Thursday after serving less than a year for the rape of a White Center woman on two occasions. A spokesperson for the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office told Fox News in an email that Carranza-Ramirez was charged with rape in the 3rd degree in October and pleaded guilty in February. OHIO TEACHER ALLEGEDLY TOUCHED DOZENS OF FEMALE FIRST-GRADERS INAPPROPRIATELY, PROSECUTORS SAY After nine months in jail (including time served as the case proceeded), Carranza-Ramirez was ordered by a judge to return to Mexico as part of a plea agreement. When contacted by Fox News, the prosecution did not confirm Carranza-Ramirez's citizenship status, but did note his criminal history did not specifically indicate he was in the U.S. illegally. Authorities say he was released on Thursday and on Saturday he tracked down the 32-year-old woman he previously terrorized. He approached the woman the following day and allegedly assaulted her.

White House feigns surprise at Pelosi 'prison' comments,"Video by FOX News House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment this week that she would rather see President Donald Trump ""in prison"" than impeached ""shows the true colors of the Democratic Party,"" the White House said Thursday. ""How shocking,"" White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp said sarcastically in an interview on Fox News. ""The Democrats are radical and out of touch. They're more focused on attacking this president, undermining this president, than they are to solving the major problems that we're seeing in the United States."" Pelosi made the comment during a meeting Tuesday night in which she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler about whether to open an impeachment inquiry into the president. Pelosi, who's resisted a growing chorus of calls for impeachment from her caucus, remained firm in that she wants to see Trump defeated at the ballot box next year, when he would then be free from the Justice Department's restraints on indicting a sitting president. ""I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,"" Pelosi said at that meeting, multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting told POLITICO . ""I think it clearly shows the true colors of Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Party that are focused and obsessed with investigation after investigation despite the fact that the president and this administration has been transparent through the whole process,"" Schlapp contended Thursday. Asked whether Pelosi's leaked comments would further imperil the White House's willingness or ability to work with congressional Democrats on things like infrastructure, Schlapp indicated that not much has changed. ""Look, I think that this president, this administration has tried time and time again to work with the Democrats,"" she asserted, though it has been Trump who orchestrated several high-profile walkouts of meetings with Democrats. ""The Democrats have continuously refused to work with our administration in solving the major problems we see in our country."" She pointed in particular to the surging number of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and cast Trump as doing what he's able with his hands tied. ""Have we seen any cooperation coming from the liberal Democrats? Absolutely not,"" she said. ""They continue to live in this world where they believe this border crisis is a manufactured crisis. The president is doing what he can from an administrative standpoint to ensure we're able to deal with the overwhelming crisis we're seeing at the border.""",politics,FOX News,right
Thousands of ex-prisoners to reunite with their families this month as part of First Step Act,"More than 2,200 federal inmates are returning to their families this month from behind bars under the bipartisan prison reform bill President Trump signed into law last year, according to policy experts and prisoner advocates involved in the effort. This month will see the largest group to be freed so far under a clause in the First Step Act that reduces sentences due to ""earned good time."" In addition to family reunification, the formerly incarcerated citizens, 90 percent of whom have been African-American, hope to get employment opportunities touted by Trump last month at the White House as part of the ""Second Chance"" hiring program. ""We're a nation that believes in redemption,"" the president said, noting Americans with criminal backgrounds are unemployed at rates up to five times the national average, which was around 3.8 percent earlier this year. ""You're gonna have an incredible future."" The Trump Administration has asked the private sector to help the ex-prisoners reacclimate to their newfound freedom with jobs and housing in one of the largest criminal justice public-private-partnerships ever assembled. Kim Kardashian West, who successfully lobbied President Trump to free Alice Johnson, a great-grandmother who was serving a life sentence convicted of drug trafficking for a first-time, non-violent drug offense, announced a partnership with rideshare organization Lyft to hand out gift cards for reformed criminals to get to and from job interviews as transportation can be a barrier. ""I just want to thank the president for really standing behind this issue and seeing the compassion that he's had for criminal justice has been really remarkable,"" the ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star said during a Second Chance Hiring and Re-entry event at the White House in June. The Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) has offered 300,000 human resources professionals behind this effort and Goodwill International pledged its national network of reentry providers. Matthew Charles, the first inmate released from the program and recognized by Trump for being a ""model citizen,"" told ""America's Newsroom"" barriers to employment and housing need to be ""eliminated"" so former inmates don't find themselves back in prison. The Trump Administration has a broad amount of support across governmental departments from labor to DOJ to DOE, as well as governors across the country streamlining state services in order to reduce the barriers Charles mentioned.

"Trump says he ""made"" Fed Chair Powell and would trade him for Europe's Draghi","President Trump said ""nobody ever heard of"" Powell before Trump named him to run the Federal Reserve.Instead, ""we should have [Mario] Draghi,"" who heads the European Central Bank, said Trump.The president has been outspokenly critical of the Fed chairman, who just yesterday stressed the need for the Fed to be independent. Washington - President Donald Trump is keeping up his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying he ""made"" Powell but now would like to trade him in for Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. In an interview on Fox Business Network, Mr. Trump said Wednesday ""we should have Draghi"" instead of Powell because of Draghi's announcement last week that he was prepared to provide more stimulus if necessary to support the lagging European economy. Mr. Trump said in contrast, Powell was ""sucking [money] like from a vacuum cleaner,"" a reference to the Fed's efforts to lower its holdings of Treasury bonds. The president said of Powell, ""Here's a guy nobody ever heard of him before, and now I made him, and he wants to show how tough he is."" Mr. Trump selected Powell to be Fed chairman after deciding not to nominate Janet Yellen for a second four-year term. Powell, a Republican, had been nominated to the Fed's seven-member board by Barack Obama, Powell took over as chairman in February 2018. As the Fed kept raising interest rates last year, the president increased his criticism of the central bank and Powell. Mr. Trump has complained that last year's four rate hikes sent the stock market into a nosedive in December as investors feared the Fed's tightening could push the country into a recession. The Fed switched course in January and declared it was prepared to be ""patient"" before changing rates again, a move that bolstered the stock market. That is, until rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China again raised recession fears last month. Last week, the Fed left rates unchanged and signaled that it was prepared to begin cutting rates if needed to protect the economy from trade battles and other risks. Demotion or firing coming? In his interview Wednesday, Mr. Trump didn't acknowledge the Fed's change in policy. Before last week's meeting, he had pressured the central bank to begin cutting rates immediately and suggested that he might demote Powell as chairman if the Fed didn't follow his advice. In his interview Wednesday, Trump insisted he had the right to demote Powell or to fire him, something legal experts dispute. They contend that Powell can be removed only for malfeasance in office, not for a policy dispute. Powell's term as chairman runs until February 2022. Mr. Trump said one reason he's unhappy with the Fed's rate hikes was that it raises the cost of borrowing for the federal government. ""I want to pay it off,"" Mr. Trump said of the debt, a pledge he had made during the 2016 presidential campaign. The growth of the $22 trillion national debt has accelerated under Mr. Trump, whose last budget projected annual deficits would top $1 trillion beginning this year. Need for political independence Trump's latest Fed attack came a day after Powell made his most extensive comments on the Fed's need for political independence to do its job. Asked about the repeated criticism by Trump, Powell said, ""We are human. We make mistakes. I hope not frequently, but we will make mistakes. But we won't make mistakes of integrity or character."" Powell said the Fed's independence from direct political control had served the country well. He added that when central banks don't have that protection, ""you see bad things happening.""",politics,Fox Business,right

Albino alligators at Florida animal park produce rare batch of 19 eggs,"Earlier this month, staff members at an animal park in Florida were delighted to learn that an albino alligator ""couple"" at their facility produced a rare batch of 19 eggs. The pair   a 25-year-old female named Snowflake and a 14-year-old named Blizzard   have lived at Wild Florida Airboats and Gator Park in Kenansville since 2017. The park's so-called ""Croc Squad"" found the eggs after noticing Snowflake began to build a nest and was extremely protective over the area, per Newsweek. EXTREMELY RARE ALBINO ALLIGATOR ARRIVES AT ILLINOIS ZOO ""Alligator moms are some of the best moms out there in the animal kingdom, but unfortunately, Snowflake is blind due to her albinism,"" Dan Munns, Wild Florida's co-owner and co-founder, told WFTV . ""To ensure these eggs have the highest chance of survival, we're relocating the eggs to a more secure location to help protect them from natural predators and monitor their progress."" In a video posted to the park's Facebook page, one Croc Squad member   Andrew Biddle   said the eggs have natural predators such as fire ants and raccoons which ""destroy alligator eggs all the time."" ""Because they are really, really rare, we want to pull them and just ensure they get every chance they can to hatch out and be successful,"" he said, echoing Munns. The eggs will be incubated for roughly 60 days. If things go as planned, officials expect the babies to hatch later this summer. With the recessive albinism gene from their parents, albino alligators are unable to create melanin to color their skin or eyes, which leaves them white with pinkish eyes, the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago explained when it announced the addition of an albino alligator in May. According to the zoo, albino alligators don't have good chances for survival in their natural habitat which includes swamps, marshes, rivers and lakes. SHARK, ALLIGATOR FOUND IN SAME FLORIDA CREEK: 'NEVER A DULL MOMENT' The bright white skin of an albino alligator makes it easier for predators to spot them and more difficult for the rare gators to camouflage themselves. Their skin is also more sensitive to the sun   which alligators depend on to regulate their body temperature. Albino alligators' skin can burn quickly in the sun and so can their eyes, which makes it difficult for these creatures to see their food and predators.

He accepted free meals and liquor from gun license holders and the so-called expediters who represented them. ""I'm sorry I harmed the reputation of the NYPD,"" Espinel said in Manhattan Federal Court, crying. ""I feel ashamed. I hate that I have damaged the trust of the community I served for over 20 years. I'm afraid I may never restore my family's pride in me, nor my pride in myself."" Prosecutors said that Espinel, 49, was in cahoots with former Lt. Paul Dean, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Judge Edgardo Ramos, who sentenced both men, said the License Division had become ""infested throughout with corruption."" Espinel and Dean had told their colleagues in the License Division that they would be more trustworthy than the sleazy cast of expediters , including a former Brooklyn prosecutor and Shomrim patrol leader, plying cops with gifts. After his arrest, Dean told the FBI about special treatment for VIPs seeking gun licenses like President Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Michael Cohen and many others. The probe of the License Division also intersected with the gifts-for-favors scandal that rocked the highest levels of the police department. Brooklyn businessman Jeremy Reichberg used his access at 1 Police Plaza to obtain a gun permit despite his lack of qualifications. ""We hold police officers to a much higher standard.

Elephant Delivers Tyson-Worthy Jab To U.S. Tourist Taking Photo,"Humans in general have a love affair going on with elephants, in part because pachyderms are intelligent, emotional and develop deep social bonds not unlike our own. That hasn't changed for a Pennsylvania teen, who was on the receiving end of a Mike Tyson-worthy jab when a female elephant raised her trunk and put an end to the teen's photo shoot. The unnamed teen was in Zambia on a 12-day mission trip with other students from her high school, Grace Prep in State College, Pennsylvania, when she and others encountered the elephant that roams freely in a 10,000-acre preserve. She seemed friendly enough, allowing other students to gently stroke her trunk. But when the teen whipped out her phone to take a photo, the elephant suddenly slapped the teen with terrific force. ""I felt like 10 people had punched me at once as I was catapulted backward and my phone flew forward to the ground,"" the teen wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News.

Test results revealed that 34 apartments were the most severely contaminated of 91 units where lead was initially discovered between 2010 and 2017, but NYCHA appealed 88 of the cases over testing methods, according to the Post . Records obtained by the newspaper show that health officials overruled its own inspectors in 83 of those cases stymying abatement of a heavy metal that can damage almost every organ and system in the body, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Children six years old and younger are especially susceptible to lead. Details of the testing were outlined in some 4,500 pages of DOHMH reports obtained by the Post through the Freedom of Information Law. The documents were released as the de Blasio administrations continues to deal with the fallout from a lead paint scandal that kicked off in 2017 and culminated with federal prosecutors bringing a lawsuit against the city, arguing that for years NYCHA officials lied about performing required inspections and hid the true conditions from federal inspectors. In January, the city settled the lawsuit after de Blasio agreed to a deal that put the agency under the thumb of a federal monitor , whose position is to provider oversight of the troubled agency. Then-chair and CEO of NYCHA, Shola Olatoye, was forced out and the city is in the midst of spending $88 million on lead testing in 135,000 public housing apartments by 2020. Exposure to lead typically occurs through peeling paint. When blood tests reveal a child is suffering from lead poisoning, DOHMH automatically sends an inspector to the child's apartment to test for lead. High-tech X-ray guns, which can scan through multiple layers of paint, were used in 88 inspections out of 97 at the 91 apartments. Of those, according to the Post , inspectors found lead levels at 34 apartments beyond what the city typical defines as conclusive evidence of lead such readings typically trigger swift remediation. But NYCHA refuted each of those findings and convinced health official to partially or completely retract removal orders for lead paint in 33 of the cases, records show. The Health Department and City Hall did not dispute the newspaper's findings, the Post notes. The de Blasio administration did not immediately return Curbed's requests for comment. ""We've significantly reduced lead exposure for kids in public housing, and now we're taking action to eliminate it altogether,"" mayoral spokesperson Marcy Miranda told the Post . ""NYCHA now immediately abates any apartment the Health Department identifies.""",health,New York Post,right
"at first democratic debate these 6 candidates beat warren on authenticity, specifics and guts","Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. Two nights, twenty candidates, and just one party: The Democrats. Debate night number one on Wednesday in Miami was billed by many as an evening featuring Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and the B Squad. To me, Wednesday night's debate was anything but that. FIRST 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE -- NIGHT 1 LIVEBLOG Warren, who is ahead in the polls and gaining steam, did not steal the show in Miami in my humble opinion. The real stars of the evening were those who showed authenticity, specifics and guts. Let's take a closer look: Authenticity Many of those stars of the evening on Wednesday were lesser-known presidential candidates before the debate, but they made the most of their opportunity to introduce themselves to a broader audience. I was struck by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's authenticity which was captured in the way she spoke about her personal experience as an Iraq war veteran. She reflected on her time serving alongside LGBT service members, united with them in defending our nation. She brought her own military experience to bear when she explained why she feels it is necessary for the U.S. to leave Afghanistan. Specifics I paid close attention to any candidate on the stage in Miami who offered specifics on how to address a particular problem facing our country. I especially valued those candidates who pointed to actual programs they have implemented or laws they have passed. It is one thing to throw around buzzwords or catchphrases. It's another to actually govern. Those candidates with executive experience showed the most gravitas when it came to providing examples of tangible results. While discussing health care, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee mentioned that he has actually signed a public health care coverage option into law in his state. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro pointed to his record of developing community-policing standards as mayor of San Antonio when asked about how he would address some of the issues surrounding gun violence and the African-American community. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio highlighted his administration's ability to deliver free universal pre-K education to parents as a building block of opportunity on his watch. Guts It doesn't take guts to memorize responses that have been focus group tested. It does take guts to stand on a stage with your peers, in front of members of your party, and call them out. My Congressman, Ohio's Tim Ryan, did that in a big way by making his fellow Democrats look in the mirror and face the fact that we have a problem connecting with America's heartland because we, Democrats, are perceived as a party by and for coastal elites. Minnesota Senator Amy Kloubachar showed moxie when she acknowledged that she worked on a number of bills that President Trump has actually signed and then point blank declared that she was not going to throw around a bunch of empty promises. Ryan and Kloubachar showed they both have the guts to lead and take a stand. I was happy to see Democrats focus mainly on policy Wednesday night and not on pummeling President Trump, or frankly taking shots at one another. Overall, it was a substantive exchange of ideas among these ten candidates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Political candidates, for any office, who just pander or repeat talking points do not impress me. I'm pretty sure most Americans are in the same boat. I am just glad there were some 2020 hopefuls on the debate stage in Miami who showed their fellow Americans that Democrats do have solutions and are not all cut from the same coastal elitist cloth.

"Norwegian tycoon's wife abduction may have been faked, was likely killed, police say","Authorities in Norway have shifted course in the investigation of the alleged abduction of the wife of one of the country's richest men, revealing on Wednesday they believe she may have been killed and her kidnapping may have been staged. Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen, who was last seen alive Oct. 31, is the wife of Tom Hagen   a media-shy real estate investor and owner of power facilities who is among the wealthiest people in Norway, boasting a total wealth of about $2 billion Norwegian kroner ($200 million). Officials have been tight-lipped about the case since January, when it was believed the 69-year-old was kidnapped after a note was discovered in the couple's house, near the capital Oslo, saying that she would be killed if a ransom wasn't paid. NORWEGIAN BILLIONAIRE RECEIVED MESSAGE ABOUT HIS ABDUCTED WIFE, LAWYER SAYS IT 'DIDN'T INCLUDE A SIGN' SHE'S ALIVE But chief police investigator Tommy Broeske said Wednesday that detectives have now changed their ""main hypothesis"" about the case because of the absence of any signs of Falkevik Hagen's life or recent contact with the alleged kidnappers. ""The most likely is that she has been exposed to a serious crime but we consider it less likely that we are facing abduction with an economic motive,"" he told reporters. ""The main hypothesis has been changed to that she has been killed."" Norwegian media had previously reported that a ransom of $10.3 million (9 million Euros), to be paid in cryptocurrency, was demanded by alleged kidnappers. Police said the alleged kidnappers had communicated with Tom Hagen by means of a digital platform that was not answerable. The note reportedly said the wife would be killed if police were involved. Broeske said police have no motive for the alleged murder and declined to say whether anyone has been arrested. NORWEGIAN BILLIONAIRE'S WIFE ABDUCTED, KIDNAPPERS DEMAND $10M RANSOM FOR HER LIFE He added that in addition to Hagen's possible killing, authorities ""cannot exclude a staged kidnapping to hide it.""

pickup driver pleads not guilty in fatal motorcycle crash,"Video by WMUR Manchester CONCORD, N.H. (AP)   A driver for a transport company who has a history of traffic arrests pleaded not guilty Tuesday to seven counts of negligent homicide in a collision with a group of motorcyclists on a rural highway. Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, was ordered to remain in preventive detention, with a judge saying his driving record poses a potential danger to the public and himself. The plea was entered by Zhukovskyy's attorney Melissa Davis in Coos County Court in Lancaster, New Hampshire. Zhukovskyy remains behind bars there. Davis didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. The Dodge pickup Zhukovskyy was driving was towing a flatbed trailer and collided with the motorcycles in Randolph early Friday evening, investigators say. He was driving erratically and crossed the center line, according to criminal complaints released Tuesday. A survivor of the crash said the trailer wiped out most of the bikers behind him. Zhukovskyy was arrested Monday morning at his home in Massachusetts and handed over to New Hampshire authorities after a court appearance that day. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Nov. 8, with the trial running through December. Connecticut prosecutors say Zhukovskyy was arrested May 11 in a Walmart parking lot in East Windsor Walmart after failing a sobriety test. Zhukovskyy's lawyer in that case, John O'Brien, said he denies being intoxicated and will fight the charge. Additionally, Zhukovskyy was arrested on a drunken driving charge in 2013 in Westfield, Massachusetts, state records show. He was placed on probation for one year and had his license suspended for 210 days, The Westfield News reported. Zhukovskyy's father, who goes by the same name, told the Boston Herald that his son is a Ukrainian national and has permanent resident status in the U.S. The younger Zhukovskyy's court file includes a letter dated Sunday from a deportation officer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement requesting details on his 2017 heroin and cocaine convictions. Records from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration indicate that the company Zhukovskyy was driving for at the time of the motorcycle crash, Westfield Transport, has been cited for various violations in the past two years, MassLive.com reported. Phones rang unanswered at the company. The owner has previously said he was cooperating with the investigation. The crash victims were members or supporters of the Marine JarHeads, a New England motorcycle club that includes Marines and their spouses and ranged in age from 42 to 62. Four were from New Hampshire, two from Massachusetts and one from Rhode Island. JarHeads president Manny Ribeiro, who survived the crash, said he just remembers an ""explosion"" and the trailer from the truck wiping out most of the bikers behind him. The crash would not have been so deadly, he said, if not for the trailer. After the crash, Ribeiro recalled seeing Zhukovskyy ""screaming and running around"" in the road before authorities arrived and took him away. The dead were identified as Michael Ferazzi, 62, of Contoocook, New Hampshire; Albert Mazza Jr., 59, of Lee, New Hampshire; Desma Oakes, 42, of Concord, New Hampshire; Aaron Perry, 45, of Farmington, New Hampshire; Daniel Pereira, 58, of Riverside, Rhode Island; and Jo-Ann and Edward Corr, both 58, of Lakeville, Massachusetts.",environmental issues,Fox News,right
Senate committee OKs $4.6 billion humanitarian aid bill for migrant crisis,"A Senate panel gave its approval Wednesday to President Trump's $4.6 billion request for funding to tackle the escalating humanitarian crisis at the southern border -- but only after funding for a wall was pulled to get Democratic approval. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill in a 30-1 vote, sending it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. The bill contains $2.9 billion to care for unaccompanied minors crossing the border and an additional $1.3 billion to care for adult asylum seekers and migrants. The Washington Examiner reports that it also included $1.1 billion for Customs and Border Protection to ""improve conditions at border entry points"" and for ""transportation, medical care and items like clothing, baby formula and other essential items."" It also includes $65 million for new immigration judges and to educate migrants on the legal process. But agreement on the Committee only came after Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., agreed to drop requests for more detention beds and to a provision that blocks money from being diverted to a wall on the border. ""Let's stay with the humanitarian aid,"" Shelby said, describing his pitch to fellow lawmakers. ""Let's keep the poison pills out."" The agreement is in response to the Trump administration's urgent request for more funding amid increasing numbers of migrants flooding across the border, many of them coming as family units and therefore complicating both housing and removals. Trump announced this month that he had secured a deal with Mexico that would see the U.S. expand its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while claims are processed, instead of applicants being released into the U.S. The Democratic-controlled House has not yet released the text of its bill, but Republican sources told Fox News that a number of ""radical"" riders were being attached by Democrats that would nullify immigration law and protect illegal immigrants who sponsor child migrants. Democrats on the committee acknowledged to Fox News that there are ""active discussions about a supplemental appropriations bill to address the humanitarian crisis President Trump has helped create at the border"" but brushed off GOP claims that such proposals would assist child smuggling as ""absurd.""

"Cruz calls for 'legal action' against Portland mayor after clash between far-right, antifa protesters","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a prominent conservative and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants federal authorities to investigate and prosecute the mayor of Portland, Ore., after Cruz accused him of ordering police to allow attacks against a conservative activist. ""To federal law enforcement: investigate & bring legal action against a Mayor who has, for political reasons, ordered his police officers to let citizens be attacked by domestic terrorists,"" Cruz tweeted early Sunday, referring to Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler. Wheeler, who is also the police commissioner, has faced criticism after Andy Ngo, a sub-editor and photojournalist for Quillette, a conservative online publication, was reportedly assaulted by antifa protesters, leaving him with scratches and a black eye. Rival demonstrations by far-right and anti-fascist groups turned into violent street clashes in Portland on Saturday, resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. Police reported the demonstrations became violent when some demonstrators starting throwing milkshakes of quick-drying cement and using pepper spray. The Daily Caller, a conservative outlet, published a photo of Ngo spattered with what appeared to be a milkshake and a bruised eye. He was later admitted to the hospital because of what a legal representative described as a ""brain bleed,"" according to the Daily Caller . Cruz retweeted a photo of Ngo and wrote, ""Sickening criminal assault. To mainstream 'journalists': don't cover this up, don't ignore it.""

"Wells Fargo, TD Bank turn over Trump financial records to House Dems","Wells Fargo and TD Bank have turned over President Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services Committee, Fox News confirmed on Thursday, amid a contentious legal battle between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats seeking access to sensitive files. The committee, led by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is one of several panels that have issued subpoenas and requests for Trump's financial files. NBC News first reported that Wells Fargo turned over a few thousand documents to the committee, and TD Bank provided a handful. The banks are two of the nine financial institutions with which congressional Democrats are seeking cooperation. The push has led to an escalating legal battle on multiple fronts. On Wednesday, a federal judge in New York ruled that two other banks, Deutsche Bank and Capitol One, were required to comply with congressional subpoenas seeking access to Trump's financial records. The House Financial Services Committee and the House Intelligence Committee both have requested the documents from Deutsche Bank and Capitol One in their investigations of possible ""foreign influence in the U.S. political process."" ""We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations,"" Deutsche Bank said in a statement to Fox News after the ruling. Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee is seeking the president's tax returns, and has issued subpoenas for the files. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would not comply with the subpoena for the president's tax returns last week, but this week, a confidential draft IRS memo was revealed calling the disclosure ""mandatory"" unless the president asserts executive privilege over the financial documents. The Washington Post first reported on the 10-page memo, which does not mention Trump by name, but appears to add a new level of pressure to the White House. Mnuchin, though, has maintained that the Democrats' requests for Trump's tax returns ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose"" and said his department will not ""disclose the requested returns and return information."" The IRS on Wednesday pushed back on that report, stating the memo does not represent an official position for the agency. The standoff between the congressional Democrats and the administration is likely to lead to a court battle, with Trump reportedly indicating he's prepared to fight all the way to the Supreme Court. Trump declined to reveal his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election, claiming he was under audit. Political candidates aren't required to disclose their tax returns, though traditionally all candidates do. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",legal arguments,Fox News,right

Trump: Iran 'better be careful' after backing away further from nuclear deal,"President Trump lobbed a strong warning to Iran on Sunday after the rogue nation announced it had ratcheted up its uranium enrichment beyond the limit allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. ""Iran better be careful. … Iran is doing a lot of bad things,"" Trump said. ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon."" Iran has said it was inching its program closer toward weapons-grade levels, while calling for a diplomatic solution to a crisis that has raised tensions with the U.S. ""Iran's latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions. Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran's nuclear program. Iran's regime, armed with nuclear weapons, would pose an even greater danger to the world,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. Iran's move, coupled with abandoning the deal's limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile earlier, has intensified pressure as the future of the accord, signed during the Obama administration remains in question. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal last year. He added Sunday, ""the Obama agreement... was the most foolish agreement that you will ever find."" Iranian officials said the new level of uranium enrichment would be reached later in the day, but did not provide the percentage they planned to hit. Under the nuclear deal, the cap for enrichment was set at 3.67 percent, a percentage closely monitored by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. ""Within hours, the technical tasks will be done and enrichment above 3.67 percent will begin,"" Iran nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said.

Jeanine Pirro is off the air at Fox News,"Jeanine Pirro was off the air at Fox News on Saturday, one week after she was widely denounced for doubting Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's patriotism. Last Saturday night Pirro questioned whether Omar's Islamic religious beliefs stand in opposition to the US Constitution, prompting Fox to say ""we strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro's comments."" The network said at the time that the views Pirro expressed ""do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly""   but declined to say if she was being sanctioned in any way. Several advertisers subsequently distanced themselves from Pirro's weekly show, called ""Justice."" The show did not appear on this weekend's cable schedule guide. In its place was an unusual repeat of a documentary series. Pirro has not said anything about taking a vacation. She hasn't tweeted since last weekend. All together, the circumstances suggest that she has been suspended by Fox in the wake of her comments. But if she has been suspended, Fox is not saying so. A network spokeswoman said ""we are not commenting on internal scheduling matters."" There is no word on whether Pirro's show will return next week. At the same time, there is no indication that she has been fired from Fox. She is one of the network's highest-rated weekend hosts, well known for her vehement defenses of President Trump and attacks against his perceived enemies. Last week Pirro targeted Omar   one of the few Muslim members of Congress   by noting Omar's religious head-covering called a hijab. ""Think about it: Omar wears a hijab,"" Pirro said. ""Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?"" Among many other critics, a Fox News staffer pushed back on Pirro's statements. Hufsa Kamal, a producer on Fox's ""Special Report with Bret Baier,"" tweeted : ""@JudgeJeanine can you stop spreading this false narrative that somehow Muslims hate America or women who wear a hijab aren't American enough? You have Muslims working at the same network you do, including myself."" When Fox condemned Pirro, she also issued a statement. She did not apologize. She said she intended to ""ask a question and start a debate."" ""Of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don't support the Constitution,"" she said. ""I invite Rep. Omar to come on my show any time to discuss all of the important issues facing America today."" Omar did not answer that invitation, but she thanked Fox News for rebuking Pirro.",politics,Fox News,right
Thousands of fish perish after fire at Jim Beam warehouse,"The Jim Beam warehouse fire in Kentucky has begun to cause environmental damage to the local wildlife, as thousands of dead fish have littered the Kentucky River and are floating downstream. Environmental officials in Kentucky say the water used to put out the blaze that consumed 45,000 barrels of bourbon has reached the nearby creek and eventually the river. ""I don't believe I would want to swim in it right now. In a few days when all this passes, it will be fine,"" local resident Kim Strohmeier told WKYT . ""A lot of fisherman in both the Elkhorn Creek and the river here...folks aren't going to have much success fishing in the river in the next few weeks"" FIRE AT JIM BEAM KENTUCKY WAREHOUSE CONTINUES TO BURN AS 45,000 BARRELS OF BOURBON ARE DESTROYED:REPORTS Strohmeier added the phenomenon was something he had never seen before. The Environmental Protection Agency is now leading the investigation to determine how much impact the contaminated water will have on the local ecosystem, according to WKYT. The agency says the number of dead fish in the Kentucky River will only increase and it's safe to fish as long as you don't eat anything caught. Residents who wish to use the waterways are being told the water can be accessed, even though the smell of the dead fish may seem intense. ""We continue to see dead and dying fish,"" Mura said. ""People using the Kentucky River in the area of the plume will see dead fish and may smell them."" KENTUCKY TELLS CHURCH GIVING AWAY USED GLASSES TO HOMELESS IT IS BREAKING LAW The warehouse originally caught fire last Tuesday night and burned through the next morning, before a containment facility was set up. Jim Mura, a spokesman for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet said they let the bourbon barrels burn off until Saturday morning to prevent the water runoff from impacting local waterways. Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources spokesman, Kevin Kelly said on Saturday it will take a couple of days to count the number of dead fish.

"Upstate New York clerk 'will not be granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants,' contrary to new law: report","An upstate New York clerk is criticizing legislation that lets undocumented migrants apply for drivers' licenses, saying he ""will not be granting drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants."" The measure was signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday, hours after it passed the state Senate. It passed the Assembly last week. In a letter Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns sent to attorney Michael Siragusa on Tuesday, he asked for representation in a lawsuit over the legislation in federal court, WIVB in Buffalo reported. Siragusa did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. WIVB reported that a spokesperson for the attorney said the letter had been delivered, and that he ""will be reviewing the request to make a determination on any potential action."" The law makes New York the 13th state to authorize driver's licenses for immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally. ""After a review of the act, I am convinced that it is inconsistent with federal law,"" Kearns wrote in the letter. ""More importantly, however, complying with the act puts me and other county clerks in the untenable position of having to decide whether to uphold federal law or the newly enacted state law. I anticipate being sued in either event."" Speaking with WIVB, Kearns also reportedly suggested the bill may be a violation of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which would make it illegal to knowingly hire illegal immigrants. Kearns told the media outlet he hopes to get the law thrown out before it is scheduled to take effect in December, adding that he won't follow the law if it does take effect. When asked if he is prepared to lose his position if he doesn't comply with the law Kearns told the television station, ""He [Governor Cuomo] has the power. However through my research, working through my legal team, we have to be charged. There has to be some charges, and I get to answer those charges. It's almost one of those things we're preparing for. I hope it doesn't happen."" Cuomo's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. His support for the bill appeared in doubt Monday after he voiced concerns that U.S. immigration officials could use state license information to target immigrants for deportation. The governor asked for a legal review by the office of Attorney General Letitia James, who said she supports the bill but wouldn't speculate on the federal response. Supporters of the bill include the state Business Council and immigrant advocates who think licenses would help immigrants get jobs.

"Trump defends deal with Mexico to stem migrant flows, prevent tariffs","President Trump on Saturday defended his agreement with Mexico that sees the country take tougher measures on illegal immigration in exchange for the U.S. dropping plans to impose tariffs on imports -promising that Mexico ""will try very hard"" and place as many as 6,000 troops at their southern border. ""Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!"" Trump tweeted. BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY' Trump announced late Friday that the U.S. had reached a deal with its southern neighbors that would see planned tariffs on Mexico stopped in return for Mexico taking further action to stop the flow of migrants from Central American to the U.S.-Mexico border. According to a joint declaration issued by the State Department, Mexico will take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border."" The U.S. will also expand its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. committed to accelerate asylum claims while Mexico said it will ""offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles."" The document said that Mexico will also take ""decisive action"" to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border. Trump tweeted on Saturday that the deal includes Mexico sending 6,000 troops to its southern border, saying that currently ""there are few!"" In that tweet, he quoted Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, who praised the deal in glowing terms and called it a ""huge deal"" and a ""game changer."" Trump also said that the U.S. ally had agreed to buy ""large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers."" For now, the deal ends plans by the Trump administration to slap a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico - something that had sparked fears from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the possible economic fallout from such a move, with concerns it could kill off an incoming trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. It also comes amid an escalating border crisis, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection reporting this week that it apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May - levels not seen in over a decade. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration at the crisis and has repeatedly blamed both Congress and Mexico for the migrant surges. Democrats remained skeptical after the agreement was announced, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeting (apparently sarcastically) that ""[n]ow that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future."" 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke, meanwhile, said that ""the damage of Trump's reckless trade policies and tariffs has already been done."" CNN PANEL KNOCKS TRUMP'S MEXICO DEAL, SUGGESTS IT'S A DISTRACTION FROM WEAK US JOB NUMBERS ""What we see is yet another example of him trying to be both the arsonist who created this problem in the first place and the firefighter who wants credit for addressing it,"" he said.

Killer of 16-year-old New York girl in 1980 released on parole despite outrage,"A New York man convicted of brutally murdering a 16-year-old girl in 1980 was released from prison Monday despite outrage from community members and criticism from the state's former governor. Richard LaBarbera, 66, walked free 38 years after he began serving a sentence of 25 years to life for the second-degree murder of Paula Bohovesky. 'SO HIDEOUS' THAT 16-YEAR-OLD NEW YORK GIRL'S KILLER IS BEING RELEASED, PATAKI SAYS IN PLEA TO CUOMO Bohovesky, an honors student, was walking home from her part-time job at the library on Oct. 28, 1980, in Pearl River, a quiet community some 30 miles north of New York City. Police say she was hit in the head with a concrete block, raped twice, strangled and stabbed five times just a block away from her home by LaBarbera and Robert McCain what the local medical examiner described as the most brutal murder he had ever seen. Both men were given the toughest sentence available at the time and had previously been denied parole every two years since becoming eligible in 2005. However, last month, LaBarbera was granted parole in a hearing with three members of the state's 12-person parole board while McCain, now 58, was denied parole . A non-profit organization ""Petition for Paula"" filed a lawsuit last week in New York Supreme Court along with the victim's mother, Lois Bohovesky , demanding that LaBarbera be given another parole hearing in front of all 12 members and that his scheduled release be delayed because full transcripts of the decisive hearing have not been released. The lawsuit also asked a judge not to allow LaBarbera to go within five counties of Pearl River because the victim's mother still lives there. The Journal News reported Monday that the state initially intended to release LaBarbera in Peekskill, less than an hour from Pearl River. However, attorneys for Lois Bohovesky convinced the state attorney general's office to reassign the parolee to an office in Buffalo and a judge in Albany ordered LaBarbera to stay at least three counties away from his victim's mother. A July 26 hearing has been scheduled to determine whether the restrictions should be made permanent. Last month, hundreds of protestors walked silently in the dark, with candles illuminating the same path Bohovesky walked on that fateful night, hoping to inspire New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to intervene in the Parole Board's decision. HUNDREDS PROTEST PLAN TO RELEASE 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S CONVICTED KILLER Former New York Gov. George Pataki told Fox News last week Cuomo should force the parole board   filled with the governor's appointees   to reconsider its decision to parole LaBarbera. ""The governor can certainly ask the parole board to take another look and to look at the facts, to look at the lack of remorse, and if they did, they would have to see that this man should not be out in the streets,"" Pataki said. ""I have been very careful about not commenting on state government policies since I left office, but this release of this rapist and murderer is so hideous to me, I really feel an obligation to speak out so that first, hopefully, it won't happen, but if it sadly does, that it won't happen again."" All of these pleas were to no avail. Opponents of LaBarbera's release, including Lois Bohovesky, contend he has neither accepted full responsibility nor shown remorse for his crime. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP ""He [LaBarbera] still hasn't taken responsibility for the murder,"" Bohovesky, 87, told Fox News last month in an exclusive on-camera interview. "" ...

"Fox's Ed Henry to Kyle Kashuv on past racist, anti-Semitic language: 'What were you thinking?'","Parkland shooting survivor Kyle Kashuv on Monday appeared on Fox News to apologize for racist comments he made while in an online chat when he was 16 years old following screenshots of the racial slurs, including the use of the N-word, that led to Harvard University rescinding Kashuv's acceptance to the school . Fox News national correspondent Ed Henry asked the teenager, ""What were you thinking?"" regarding the past language. ""Well, at that time, it was really a friend group on who can say the most shocking thing, the most extreme thing for the sake of shock value,"" Kashuv said. ""I'm extremely sorry for it and I wish I could take it back but I can't."" The apology came after Kashuv revealed in a Twitter thread that Harvard had rescinded his acceptance to the Ivy League school. In a series of tweets Monday, Kashuv called his remarks, which were made months before the February 2018 mass shooting at the school, ""offensive,"" ""inflammatory"" and ""idiotic,"" while adding that the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had changed him. ""All I can do now is seek to right the wrong. And I know forgiveness isn't given, it's earned. I know that the person who wrote those things is not who I am today,"" Kashuv said in his Fox News appearance. Henry pressed the teenager. ""How do we know that?"" Henry asked. ""You certainly sound heartfelt, but you want to get something - you want to get into Harvard or get into another school. And how do we know that you're not just saying 'Oh, I didn't mean it?' "" Kashuv then mentioned that Harvard was founded by slave owners in the 1600s, to which Henry pushed back. ""You're mentioning that they had slave owners in the 1600s. You using the N-word was, what, a year, a year-and-a-half ago?"" Henry said. ""Two years ago,"" Kashuv replied. ""Two years ago,"" Henry said. ""A little more recent. I go back to my first question: How do we know that you've really changed? What specifically - you went through an awful tragedy in Florida - and have been hailed by some, and you should be, for your poise going through a tragedy that I can't even imagine. But what specifically has changed in you the past two years where you would no longer write the N-word or say the N-word?"" ""It's because I matured tremendously,"" Kashuv replied. ""I no longer am in the friend group where we act immaturely, like idiotic children. It's the fact that I have condemned racism in every opportunity that I can in this public life that I didn't really ask for."" ""I never wanted and never quite frankly wanted to be in the position,"" the 18-year-old said. ""I'm not an entertainer, I'm not an actor. I'm a kid who went through a tragedy who saw the suffering that his community went through and doesn't want to see it for any other community."" According to the Washington Times and HuffPost, classmates had accused Kashuv of repeatedly using the N-word.

latin american festivals you've never tried,"This story was originally published in 2014. Festival dates will have changed. Last year, Lainie Liberti and her teenager decided to fly down to Latin America and see the real Peru. Be careful what you ask for. Just to reach the site for the Qoylllur Rit'i festival, the Californian single mom and her son had to hire a guide and begin the journey uphill into the Andes. Six hours   and many meters   later, the two reached a mountainous peak and found a valley below full of Andean peasants setting up tents for the annual three-day extravaganza. In the end, thousands would attend to watch a sea of colorful religious processions of pilgrims in traditional garb of feathers and streamers, some carrying blocks of ice from nearby glaciers thought to possess medicinal qualities. In keeping with Incan astrology, hundreds watched the sunrise over the surrounding mountains, the event's touchstone event. Liberti says she left in awe, after a ""life-altering experience."" For many travelers, it's one of the best reasons to come to Latin America: the bevy of cultural festivals that range from the rowdy to the mystical. Some of the activities can be pricey   or as Brazilians say, ""salty""   and many are hard to reach, deep in the Amazon or far into the foggy highlands of Guatemala. But as many as 100,000 experience-seekers come to these celebrations, which include everything from ""flying pole dancers"" to loinclothed triathlon racers.

The so-called Snow Star Festival is a syncretized religious festival linking Catholic and indigenous histories into a folkloric pop-up tent party in a remote Andean valley.

June 26: Parintins Folk Festival in Parintins, Brazil. Also known as Boi Bumbá, this cultural festival in the heart of the Amazon is something between a folkloric play and Carnaval, all mixed into one, centered on the legend of two rival oxen.

At this religious festival in the cloudy hills of Chi-Chi, the town's 100,000 K'iche' Maya indigenous people host a celebration for their town's patron saint, Saint Thomas. The highlight of the eight days is the Palo Voador, when acrobats summit the tops of 100-foot wooden poles, tie ropes around their ankles and then swing upside down at high speeds.

metro council passes controversial budget in 24-1 vote,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WHAS11)   Officials with Metro Council have overwhelmingly passed the operating budget by a 24 to 1 vote. The city needs to trim around $25 million to make up for its pension obligations. Councilwoman Madonna Flood was the sole no vote. She says that she could not in conscience vote for it and that it would hurt the most vulnerable people. Councilman Anthony Piagentini released a statement on Twitter saying, ""This budget was done in the right way. The Mayor proposed a budget and Metro Council, the voice of the people, changed it to reflect the will of the people. Overwhelming bipartisan consensus."" Metro Councilmembers also voted 25-0 for its capital budget. That budget helps to improve infrastructure. Mayor Greg Fischer's full statement: ""Metro Council has approved a budget that reflects the difficult realities caused by our increasing state pension obligation. This increasing obligation is not the fault of Metro Council nor my office; however, when faced with the choice to raise revenue to prevent reductions in services to our citizens, Metro Council voted against new revenue. ""This budget is not what a thriving city like ours deserves, and it is not the budget that any of us want. ""Because we already have a lean government, there were no easy decisions. I proposed a balanced budget that prioritized public safety and basic city services, while working to minimize the pain on our most vulnerable citizens. ""Though the Council approved 99.5% of the budget I proposed, and I do appreciate that, I would not be doing my job if I did not share with you my concerns about their changes, including that their choices may deepen inequities in our community. ""While I understand and share the desire to keep our library hours the same   and I love our libraries   Council does that by closing Youth Detention Services, before we can work out a solution with the State to keep our most vulnerable youth near their families and their schools. ""The desire to keep the Middletown library is understandable, but Council has done that with deep cuts to our violence prevention efforts. ""And Council has increased their neighborhood spending accounts by cutting the offices that work to create economic development throughout our city, and the office that makes Metro Government more efficient. ""While I disagree with these choices, my team will move forward, balance the budget and find ways to implement them with the least amount of pain to our residents. My thanks go to Budget Chair Bill Hollander for his leadership throughout this process. ""With our pension costs continuing to increase over the coming years, more cuts will keep coming. I don't like it, but that's reality. I understand that many people do not want to raise taxes, but no one likes service cuts either. We must face the reality that we must have new revenue if we want to continue to pursue greatness for our city. ""I pledge to continue to work with the State and our Metro Council to find new revenue, and to keep fighting to make sure Louisville has the services it needs to be the thriving, compassionate city that we all deserve.""

city kicks off months-long park closure for washington square water conservation upgrades,"North Beach , Telegraph Hill Much of Washington Square Park will be off-limits this summer to allow for renovations aimed at reducing the site's water usage by two-thirds. The children's playground and recently renovated restrooms will remain open through the summer. But fences have been erected around the rest of the park's perimeter that are expected to remain in place through the end of 2019 to allow for completion of the $3.1 million improvement project. The six-month closure will give workers time to replace the park's irrigation and drainage systems, improve landscaping with drought-tolerant plants, and repave paths to make them ADA compliant. Construction began on June 20, 2019, and the park is expected to reopen sometime in late December, according to SF Rec and Park deputy director of communications and public affairs Tamara Aparton. The irrigation system replacement itself is expected to reduce the 1.5 acre park's annual water usage by two-thirds   from more than 3.3 million gallons to 1.1 million gallons. It will include weather-sensing components that prevent the system from turning on when the park is already receiving enough water during rainy periods. In 2012, the Recreation and Park Department and the SF Public Utilities Commission collaborated to develop a Parks Water Conservation Plan based off a 2009 audit conducted by SFPUC. Washington Square was found to use the most water per acre of all of the city's parks each year. The drainage system improvements will address the park's ongoing problem of over-saturation, making the lawn more accessible (and pleasurable) for sitting and playing. According to FoundSF and Friends of Washington Square , the park is one of San Francisco's initial three public squares, dedicated as a public space by the city's first mayor, John Geary, in 1850. It was initially rectangular, spanning the full block between Powell, Stockton, Filbert, and Union streets, but construction of Columbus Avenue in 1873-1875 cut off a small corner. The small park at Powell and Columbus, Marini Plaza , will remain open during the Washington Square construction, although one of its trees may be replaced, according to project renderings. Union Square and Portsmouth Square, the other two initial public spaces in San Francisco, have both been transformed into rooftop parks atop city parking garages. The Parks Water Conservation Plan identified 11 other parks across the city that have the greatest potential for water savings: Balboa Park, Buena Vista Park, Stern Grove, GGP Panhandle, Larsen Ball Fields, Junipero Serra Playground, Parkside Square, Marina Green, GGP Big Rec, St. Mary's Park, and James Rolph Park. Alamo Square underwent a similar irrigation and drainage system upgrade in 2016-2017 at a cost of $5.3 million. Over $1 million of the funding for the Washington Square Park improvements is coming from the 2012 Rec & Park Bond , but the largest part of the bill is being covered by a $1.4 million one-time line item in the city's general fund secured by District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin. The $625,700 in landscape improvements are being paid for through the SFPUC's Large Landscape Grant Program . During the park's closure, neighbors are encouraged to visit one of the many nearby Rec and Park locations, such as the Michelangelo Playground at Greenwich and Jones, Pioneer Park at Filbert and Kearny, or Joe DiMaggio Playground at Powell and Lombard streets.",politics,Fox News,right
Trump congratulates Navy SEAL for acquittal on war crimes charges: 'Glad I could help!',"President Trump on Wednesday praised a Navy SEAL who was acquitted of committing war crimes in the killing of a wounded ISIS captive in Mosul, Iraq. ""Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""You have been through much together. Glad I could help!"" A jury of seven soldiers found Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher not guilty on Tuesday of charges that included killing unarmed civilians. Gallagher was found guilty of wrongfully posing with the corpse of the 12-year-old ISIS fighter, a charge that carries a maximum prison sentence of four months. Trump's tweet came after a Wednesday interview on ""Fox & Friends"" during which Gallagher thanked Trump, Fox News and two congressmen for their support during his trial. The president had previously considered pardoning Gallagher if he was found guilty. ""They tried to frame me as a criminal from the get-go, but we knew the truth the whole time,"" Gallagher told Fox News. ""We knew I was innocent of these charges the whole time and I overcame it by having my strong wife with me the whole time."" Video by Reuters Two Navy SEALs in Gallagher's unit testified that they saw Gallagher stab the fighter, but one changed his story on the stand by saying he, and not Gallagher, caused the victim's death by suffocating him.

"Kim Jong Un may use summit with Xi to send nuke deal message to Trump, defector says","A former North Korean diplomat believes Kim Jong Un wants to make a deal with President Trump over the Hermit Kingdom's hotly-disputed nuclear program   and the ex-diplomat thinks Chinese President Xi Jinping may be the one to deliver the message. Thae Yong Ho, who defected from North Korea in 2016, told reporters Thursday he thinks Kim will give Xi a message during their ongoing summit to hand over to Trump next week, when the leaders of the two global superpowers are set to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit . ""Kim is trying to use Xi's visit to deliver his new approach to the U.S. side,"" Thae said, according to The Straits Times. ""Xi may deliver this new offer directly to Trump and now it will be up to Trump to decide whether he would accept this new proposal or not."" Slideshow by photo services Any offer, he added, might be strategically focused on nuclear facilities and uranium enrichment sites in North Korea that Trump previously has said he wants to be shuttered. ""If Kim succeeds in convincing Trump to make a deal on past nuclear facilities and succeeds in keeping the current nuclear missiles, then it would mean to North Korea that it can be accepted as a new nuclear state in the region,"" The Straits Times quoted Thae as saying. A report recently released by the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University said that, in just the past year , Pyongyang has produced enough highly-enriched uranium and plutonium to make five to seven nuclear bombs. That adds to what the center says is already an arsenal of 30 warheads. Thae, who was in Japan on Thursday to promote a book he wrote, believes an offer to Trump through Xi would be a successful way to bring the sides back together after talks between Kim and Trump in Vietnam broke down earlier this year. Using Xi as one of the world's most high-profile intermediaries could, he said, lay the groundwork for a third summit between Trump and Kim, who have been unable to agree about what the next step should be for North Korea's nuclear program. The U.S. wants North Korea to dismantle the program entirely before any international sanctions are dialed back, but North Korea, the Associated Press says, is seeking a step-by-step approach where concessions they make would be matched at the same time by ones from the U.S. Fox News' Greg Palkot contributed to this report.",politics,Fox News,right

Ngo, a contributor for Quillette who covers Antifa, was seen on video being punched, kicked and doused with a milkshake during a clash between Antifa and those of the right-wing hate group Proud Boys on Saturday. Several people were arrested throughout the day, but Dhillon said those apprehended attacked police, and the people responsible for the attack on Ngo have not been held responsible.

JOURNALIST VIOLENTLY ATTACKED BY ANTIFA RECALLS 'COMPLETE ANARCHY AND LAWLESSNESS' Police were not seen in the video of Ngo's attack, and Dhillon argued that authorities in the city of Portland were not adequately prepared for what they should have known would be a violent confrontation between the two groups. She explained that although the police chief is responsible for designing a plan and presence, the mayor and other city leaders give specific instructions to law enforcement during such events. ""The situation on the ground in Portland and policing is so bad that the sheriffs of the adjoining counties have refused to send mutual aid to Portland because they don't want their own officers to be attacked,"" Dhillon said.

Trump hits polling on Fox News: 'Something weird going on at Fox',"President Trump on Monday dismissed a new poll from Fox News that showed him losing to multiple 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, saying ""something weird"" is happening at the network favored by conservatives. . @FoxNews Polls are always bad for me. They were against Crooked Hillary also. Something weird going on at Fox. Our polls show us leading in all 17 Swing States. For the record, I didn't spend 30 hours with @abcnews , but rather a tiny fraction of that. More Fake News @BretBaier - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2019 Fox News on Sunday released a poll that showed Trump trailing five Democratic presidential contenders in hypothetical 2020 match-ups. The survey showed former Vice President Joe Biden leading Trump by 10 points. It also showed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) carrying a 9-point lead in a hypothetical head-to-head match-up. Three other Democratic candidates - Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg - also polled ahead of Trump, albeit within the survey's margin of error. A Quinnipiac University survey released last week also showed Trump trailing a number of Democratic contenders, including Biden by 13 points. Trump has repeatedly downplayed recent polling of his 2020 election prospects in the last week. The president tweeted earlier Monday that ""only fake polls"" showed him behind 2020 Democrats, referring to them as a ""Motley Crew."" ""We are looking really good, but it is far too early to be focused on that,"" he said. ""Much work to do! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" The new comments from Trump came just a day after news surfaced that his campaign had cut ties with some of its pollsters following a leak of internal surveys that showed Trump trailing Biden in multiple key states. Trump is known to have a cordial relationship with many Fox News personalities and has appeared on the network more than any other. But he has increasingly criticized it over its campaign coverage, particularly when it chooses to cover 2020 Democrats. He said in May that Fox News host Chris Wallace was ""wasting airtime"" by hosting a town hall with Buttigieg. ""Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems,"" he said, adding, ""They forgot the people who got them there.""",politics,Fox News,right
Fox News's Shep Smith calls out Trump joking with Putin: Russian treatment of journalists 'not exactly the same',"Fox News host Shepard Smith on Friday called out President Trump after he shared a joke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they expressed their frustration with journalists.

Fake news is a great term, isn't it? You don't have this problem in Russia, but we do."" ""Yes, we have too. The same,"" Putin responded in English. Smith played the clip on his show before commenting on the exchange. ""Not exactly the same,"" he clarified, ""because the Russian president has a history of ordering the murders of journalists, as well as his political rivals."" ""And they joked about journalists there,"" Smith added. Trump also bonded with Putin over a scorn for journalists. ""Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn't it? You don't have this problem in Russia, but we do."" ""We also have,"" Putin answered, in English. ""It's the same."" They shared a chuckle. pic.twitter.com/atGGYxnwfc - Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 28, 2019 While Trump regularly deems reporting he doesn't like ""fake news"" and calls the press the ""enemy of the people,"" numerous Russian journalists and critics of Putin have wound up dead over the years. Russia ranks near the bottom among all nations worldwide in terms of press freedom, according to the World Press Freedom Index . As journalists shouted questions at Trump during the sit-down with Putin on Friday, asking if the president would tell Russia not to meddle in U.S. elections, Trump offered a deadpan response . ""Yes, of course, I will. Don't meddle in the election, please. Don't meddle in the election,"" Trump said, pointing to Putin and sporting a grin. Smith opened the segment on his show by noting that over the course of his nearly two-year investigation former special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia launched a sweeping campaign to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

man says he killed black teen for listening to rap music. activists want #justiceforelijah,"PHOENIX - A man arrested on suspicion of killing a 17-year-old boy in an Arizona convenience store last week says that he killed the teenager, who did not say or do anything to threaten him, because he was listening to rap music, police said. The suspect, Michael Paul Adams, 27, admitted stabbing the teenager at 1:42 a.m. Thursday after he heard him playing rap music in his vehicle in a parking lot at a Circle K in Peoria, Arizona, according to police records filed in Arizona Superior Court. Adams had just been released from the Arizona State Prison Complex in Yuma on Tuesday, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections. Adams told police rap music makes him feel ""unsafe"" because he had been attacked by people who listen to rap music in the past, records say. He also said people who listen to rap music are a threat to him and the community. The suspect said he felt threatened by the music   not the teen himself   so he needed to be ""proactive rather than reactive,"" police records said. Surveillance footage shows the teen walking into the convenience store and Adams walking in a few seconds later. Adams walked around the store before lunging at the teen, according to records. Adams used his pocketknife to stab the teen in the back and slit his throat. The teen ran out of the store before collapsing underneath the gas pump canopy, where police began CPR. He was taken to a hospital, but died at 2:05 a.m., records say.. Adams was arrested on 67th Avenue near the Circle K, where he told an officer he was involved in the stabbing after being found with blood on his body and clothes. Adams was booked into a Maricopa County jail on suspicion of first-degree premeditated murder and is being held on a $1 million bond. He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing July 15. Adams' criminal history includes theft, shoplifting, marijuana violation, disorderly conduct, assault with a weapon and aggravated assault of a correctional employee, according to Maricopa County Superior Court records. Jacie Cotterell, Adams' lawyer, questioned his ability to access mental health services after he was released from prison. She said that he was ""set up for failure."" Adams needed to see a mental health counselor but he was not given a way to access those resources, Cotterell said. ""To be specific, he was given resources, he wasn't given means to get to those resources,"" she said. She said Adams' family did not know where he was after his release. ""He was on the street,"" she said. Bill Lamoreaux, a spokesman with the Arizona Department of Corrections, said in a written statement that Adams ""was not designated seriously mentally ill."" He said Adams was provided contacts for community services such as continuing care, housing and welfare. Adams was provided transportation to Maricopa County from the Yuma prison. From there, ""he was no longer under the Department's legal jurisdiction and the Department had no further legal authority over him,"" according to the statement from Lamoreaux. Lamoreaux said Adams will face justice in court. ""The tragic death is terrible, and Mr. Adams will have to answer for his alleged actions,"" he said in the statement.

GOP lawmaker suggests Colin Kaepernick move to a different country,"Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, suggested former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick should consider moving to another country if he is unhappy with the United States. When asked to weigh in on the controversy over Nike sneakers with a Revolutionary War-era flag, Brooks told SiriusXM Patriot's Breitbart News Tonight that Kaepernick ""ought to consider moving to a country where he believes the laws are better for his purposes."" Kaepernick, who is well known for his political activism, made headlines last week when he complained to Nike, who sponsors him, about their ""Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July"" trainer because it featured an image of the Betsy Ross version of the American flag. He told the company it shouldn't sell a shoe with a symbol that he and others consider offensive because the flag marked an era when slavery existed in the United States, according to the Wall Street Journal . After the company shipped the shoes to retailers, Nike asked for them to be returned. In a statement, Nike spokeswoman Sandra Carreon-John said, ""NIKE made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday."" The Betsy Ross American flag is the nickname for the design of 13 stars that represents the 13 colonies arranged in a circle. It has been used periodically by some white supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, but it does not appear in the Anti-Defamation League's database of hate symbols and is widely seen as a patriotic flag that even appeared at former President Barack Obama's second inauguration. Brooks said there are some ""very radical people in the United States of America who don't like America."" ""They don't like the foundational principles that have made us a great nation, and I would put Mr. Kaepernick in that category ... In my mind, perhaps he ought to consider moving to a country where he believes the laws are better for his purposes,"" he continued. ""I doubt he will do that because in this country we've had over a million Americans die fighting for our liberties. All of these things that we enjoy he seems to frown upon, and so I just assume he'd leave.""",politics,Breitbart News,right

Cruz adds 'context' after Kaepernick quotes from Frederick Douglass 'Fourth of July' speech,"Sen. Ted Cruz responded Thursday night after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick posted a passage earlier on the Fourth of July from a famous speech by Civil War-era abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The passage Kaepernick cites is from Douglass' speech, ""What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"" Douglass delivered the speech at a meeting of the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society in Rochester, N.Y. , on July 5, 1852   nearly nine years before the Civil War began. MCCONNELL THROWS SHADE AT NIKE WITH 'BETSY ROSS' FLAG TWEET Kaepernick posted the following portion, without adding any comments: ""What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? This Fourth of July is yours, not mine ... There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour."" But the former San Francisco 49ers signal-caller includes a video montage of a longer version of the speech, accompanied by drawings depicting American slaves and photos from the Civil War era. Interspersed are videos from recent years, showing police using force against people of color. ""You quote a mighty and historic speech by the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass,"" Sen. Cruz writes in response, ""but, without context, many modern readers will misunderstand."" Cruz goes on to acknowledge that slavery was an ""abomination"" in the U.S. but was eliminated through the efforts of Douglass and ""so many other heroes."" Related video by FOX News The senator then asserts that Douglass ""was not anti-American; he was, rightly and passionately, anti-slavery."" As evidence, Cruz quotes another portion of the same Douglass speech: ""Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. ""There are forces in operation, which must inevitably, work the downfall of slavery. 'The arm of the Lord is not shortened,' and the doom of slavery is certain. ""I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from 'the Declaration of Independence,' the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age."" After quoting Douglass, Cruz then writes: ""Let me encourage everyone, READ THE ENTIRE SPEECH; it is powerful, inspirational, and historically important in bending the arc of history towards justice."" The senator then includes a link to the full text of the Douglass speech. Kaepernick has gained notoriety in recent years for drawing attention to the issue of police use of force against African-Americans and other minorities. It began with his kneeling protests during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games and continued in other ways after he left the league. Earlier this year, Kaepernick reached a settlement with the NFL after being unable to get a job with another team since leaving the 49ers. This week, the former quarterback made headlines for opposing the so-called Betsy Ross flag added to a new design of Nike sneakers, viewing the flag as a reminder of slavery. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The apparel company agreed to halt sales of the sneaker after Kaepernick's complaint, ""based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend"" people. Kaepernick has been an endorser of Nike products .

Gabbard was most searched Democratic candidate after debate despite getting third-lowest speaking time,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a relative unknown mired at the bottom of the crowded Democratic 2020 presidential field, was the most searched candidate on Google by the time Wednesday's debate ended, making the Hawaii lawmaker and military veteran one of the night's biggest winners. Google Trends data show that prior to the debate, Gabbard was the most searched only in her home state, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., dominated the country's Internet browsers. That changed when the debate was over, with Gabbard being the most searched candidate on Google in most states, with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a distant second. TULSI GABBARD'S SISTER CALLS OUT MSNBC FOR FAVORING ELIZABETH WARREN IN THE DEBATE Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who served in Iraq, grabbed the attention of the viewers every time she spoke about foreign policy and the military. During the debate, she called for scaling back U.S. military presence abroad and said ""this president and his chicken hawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran."" Slideshow by Tribune News Service Gabbard's military experience gave her authority in a harsh exchange with Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who said the U.S. must maintain forces in Afghanistan to ensure the Taliban is kept in check. ""When we weren't in there, they started flying planes into our buildings,"" Ryan said. *""The Taliban didn't attack us on 9/11, Al Qaeda attacked us on 9/11,"" Gabbard replied. The data show that the moment that generated the most search traffic for Gabbard was when she was making her closing argument. MEGHAN MCCAIN CALLS TULSI GABBARD 'THE MOST COMPOSED AND AUTHENTIC' IN FIRST DEM DEBATE The Hawaii congresswoman's performance at the debate was praised by even some unlikely media figures, including Meghan McCain, a co-host of ""The View,"" who said she was the most ""composed and authentic."" ""Tulsi and I literally couldn't disagree on more (and she fundraised off of my name for calling her out on her relationship with Assad) BUT so far she's coming across the most composed and authentic,"" McCain wrote. Gabbard's success came despite receiving the third-lowest amount of speaking time with just 6.6 minutes, according to the Washington Post. Warren got the third-highest amount of speaking time with 9.3 minutes, outpaced by Booker with 10.9 minutes and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke with 10.3 minutes.

"looking ruff! scamp the tramp wins world's ugliest dog contest beating 18 other pooches who showed off their droopy tongues, bowed legs and perpetually confused looks","Scamp the Tramp will never win a beauty contest. But he's won an ugly one. The bug-eyed, dreadlocked pooch took top honors Friday night at the 31st annual World's Ugliest Dog Contest. Owner Yvonne Morones of Santa Rosa, California, won an appearance with Scamp on the 'Today' show, $1,500 in cash, another $1,500 to donate to an animal shelter - and a trophy the size of a Rottweiler. 'He's Scamp the Champ, no longer Scamp the Tramp,' Morones told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat after the victory. 'I think the audience saw his beautiful spirit and everything he's given back to the community.' Scamp makes volunteer visits to schoolchildren and a local senior citizens center. The street dog from Compton was rescued by Morones in 2014 after she spotted him on Pet Finder. 'It was on the way home that I knew I made the right choice,' she said in a contest press statement. 'There we were, two strangers in a car on the way home to a new start. Bob Marley was playing 'One Love' and I looked over and little Scamp was bobbing his head. It was like he knew he had found his forever home.' Scamp beat out 18 other contestants who showed off their droopy tongues, bowed legs, perpetually confused looks and other strange attributes. The contestants got to walk the red carpet and preen for adoring fans at Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds in the heart of Northern California wine country. The competition, as they say, was fierce. Second place went to Wild Thang, a Pekinese with beady eyes and a disturbing tongue, owned by Ann Lewis of Los Angeles. Third place went to Tostito , a Chihuahua whose damaged ears and droopy tongue make him look like he just stuck his foot into an electrical socket. Tostito , owned by Molly Horgan of Falmouth, Maine, also won the Spirit Award. This year's People's Choice Award went to Meatloaf, a bulldog mix with protruding teeth owned by Denae Pruner of Sacramento, California. Everyone knows ugliness is in the eye of the beholder and, to a dog lover, there is no such thing as an uncomely canine. Weird-looking, maybe. Appearance-challenged, perhaps. Or, as owners of ugly dogs like to say, 'unique.' Like Willie Wonka, a sweet-natured pit bull abandoned after he was discovered to have a genetic malady that left his legs so bowed he could barely walk. With a chuckle, publicist Christy Gentry said the competition wasn't just about being ugly. 'Judges are looking for special attributes like hanging tongues, slobber, drool (the more the better). Maybe unusual patches of skin or hair,' she explained. Video courtesy of NBC Bay Area Last year's champion, an English bulldog named Zsa Zsa, with a tongue that hung nearly to the ground, endeared herself to the judges when she sneezed and drooled all over them. Soon she was headed to New York for national TV appearances. Sadly, Zsa Zsa died about a year ago at age 9. Another previous winner, Nana, made the cover of an album by the Grateful Dead spinoff band Ratdog. Organizers say the contest isn't just skin-deep. It's also about bringing attention to the needs of rescue dogs. Most competitors were previously abandoned or rescued from kill shelters in the U.S., found abandoned on streets or seized from unscrupulous breeders. 'What we're really doing is we're showcasing dogs that have been rescued and adopted and brought into loving homes,' Gentry said. 'These are sort of spokesdogs for adoption.'",politics,National Review,right

donald trump's criminal justice reform shows results,"Most people are not aware of the First Step Act, signed into law by President Trump in December of 2018. It is a major achievement in improving the criminal justice system, long overdue. This law seeks to incentivize prison inmates to participate in training programs targeted at increasing opportunities once released. Participation can earn as many as 47 days per year knocked off their sentences. Inmates also earn lighter sentences while ensuring, after release, they will become a productive member of society. We all want to see criminals pay their debts for committing crimes, particularly violent felonies. No argument there. But imposing extreme sentences on people who will spend 20 to 50 years behind bars does nothing to rehabilitate. Rather, it further reduces opportunities for ex-inmates to become productive citizens. Some want to see criminals enter prison for decades. But we forget that most of those inmates will be coming out one day, with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Not everyone has family members or friends. Not all have support systems. Many are released without any source of income. Ricky L. was a 31-year-old armed robber who had spent nearly 90% of his adult years in prison. He had no friends or family. No money, no transportation. When he applied for jobs, he was rejected because of his felony record. Finally, he resorted to committing a series of crimes in hopes of getting caught. Still free, he checked himself into a hospital and confessed to doctors. Ricky wanted to go ""home."" He didn't know how to be free. He died in prison. The president deserves kudos for his latest efforts in tackling long overdue needs of the criminal justice system in America. At a White House event this month, President Trump was joined by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and justice reform advocate and TV star Kim Kardashian West, who was a key figure in obtaining the release of Matthew Charles from a Tennessee prison. Charles spent two decades incarcerated for selling crack cocaine. Legislators and judges are certainly concerned about getting elected, or re-elected. A death knell against winning at the polls is to appear ""soft on crime,"" generally measured in sentencing practices. That, in turn, results in many years behind bars accomplishing nothing. Judges are subject to following rules. Sentences for many felonies are spelled out in minimum mandatory guidelines from which judges cannot ignore. The First Step Act helps judges circumvent minimum mandatories, in appropriate situations. Too often, an 18-year-old makes a mistake for which he will pay until he's 90 years old. Charles was the first person to be released under the First Step Act. According to the National Review, another 1,151 crack cocaine sentences have been reduced. With Trump by her side, Kardashian West announced that she has also been working on a ride sharing program to help former inmates get transportation to jobs and/or interviews. I have often written about the extreme and morally damaging sentencing practices of the modern era. Our prison system is supposed to be a source of rehabilitation, when in fact, it is little more than a system for warehousing human beings. Yes, we want bad people punished. Their victims deserve that. But we also must deal with the final outcome at the end of that tunnel. Overall, warehousing is a costly endeavor. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, taxpayers spend an average of $31,000 per year, per inmate. California's average is $60,000. That does not take into account the population of aging inmates, where costs run much higher. The prison population has now soared to roughly 131,000 inmates over age 55. That's a lot of medical expenses. America houses approximately 2.3 million people in jails and prisons. Prison rates in the U.S. are the world's highest at 724 per 100,000. Russia is second, at 581 per 100,000. We need to do better. The First Step Act is a great start. Marshall Frank is a retired police captain from Miami-Dade County, author and frequent contributor.

If you don't like his policy, he's also open to your policy, rather than just criticizing his. He's trying to send a message to the other countries, 'this is not the way you do it,' because this is a country that has rules and laws. We just can't let everybody in that wants to be here.""

Purple Heart Found Among Housewares Donated To Tucson Goodwill,"Video by FOX News TUCSON, AZ   There it was, the bronze relief bust of George Washington on a Purple Heart nestled in a purple-lined box that was tucked in a box of housewares donated to a Goodwill store in Tucson. On the back of the prestigious military decoration, as polished as it was on the day it was issued, was a clue: the name of Nick D'Amelio Jr., a Navy seaman second class. Purple Heart medals, given to soldiers who are injured or killed in action, are as precious as they are beautiful. Almost as old as the country itself, the Purple Heart was instituted by the nation's first president in 1782 to honor bravery in action during the Revolutionary War. Originally a purple heart-shaped piece of cloth edged in silver braid that was sewn into the soldier's coat, the Purple Heart was all but forgotten until it was revived on the 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. This one shouldn't be forgotten, the staff at Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona resolved. They're accustomed to finding rare, valuable and odd items among in the bins of donations they sort. ""If you can think of it, we've probably gotten it here,"" Talon Mills, an associate at the Goodwill store on Tucson's east side told news station KGUN. ""I was going through a box, just like any other day """" Mills told the news outlet of his discovery in mid-June. ""And there was that small box right there. I opened it   recognized it right away   knew what it was."" Surely the Purple Heart had been accidentally donated , Mills thought. ""Did the recipient of the medal give it away?,"" Mills told news station KOLD. ""Did their family, not knowing it was in the box?"" However the Purple Heart wound up at the Goodwill, it wasn't put on the store shelves. Mills turned it over to his manager, and they've been on a detective mission to return it to D'Amelio's family. What they've learned is that D'Amelio never came home from World War II. He was reported missing in action when the USS Little was peppered by Japanese machine guns and sank in the shark-infested waters surrounding the Solomon Islands on Sept. 5, 1942, according to military records and online accounts of the World War II attack. A year after the ship sank, D'Amelio was declared dead and the Purple Heart was later awarded posthumously. He is memorialized in Walls of the Missing at The Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines. ""It's important that we get it to the right family ,"" Judith Roman Bucasas, director of marketing of Goodwill Industries of Southern Arizona, told CNN. ""This guy didn't get to make it back home."" The search has turned up some leads, but they've fizzled. Bucasas reached out to Purple Hearts Reunited , a nonprofit that works to return lost, stolen or misplaced military medals of valor to veterans and their families, to help find D'Amelio's family. What they've learned about D'Amelio is that he entered the service in California and had family in New York. ""We know the person did something really heroic, or that person gave the ultimate sacrifice ,"" Bucasas told KGUN. ""And I think being in a military town, it's important for us to be able to serve our service members in that way, too."" To help with the search, the Tucson Goodwill store posted a photo of the medals on Facebook and asked for the help of anyone who might know the family.",crime,FOX News,right
Federal judge sides with House Democrats over subpoena for Trump's financial records,"Video by GeoBeats A Washington, D.C.-based federal judge has sided with House Oversight Committee Democrats seeking to enforce their subpoena of Trump accounting firm Mazars USA , in a major ruling that breathes new life into Democrats' ongoing efforts to probe the president's financial dealings. The subpoena seeks access to a slew of Trump financial documents dating back to 2011. Democrats pursued the subpoena after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that the president routinely and improperly altered financial statements. Barack Obama-appointed judge Amit P. Mehta's 41-page opinion began by comparing President Trump's concerns over congressional overreach to those of President James Buchanan, asserting that Trump ""has taken up the fight of his predecessor."" And Mehta acknowledged that he was ""well aware that this case involves records concerning the private and business affairs of the President of the United States."" But, Mehta said, Democrats' subpoena fell within well-established congressional investigative powers. He said he would not stay his ruling pending appeal. ""It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct past or present even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,"" Mehta wrote. The president's legal team, in a filing earlier this month, had asked the judge to prohibit Mazars from ""enforcing or complying"" with the subpoena, issued April 15. Trump's lawyers had argued the subpoena to Mazars ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose,"" and is an ""unconstitutional attempt to exercise 'the powers of law enforcement.'"" Trump's lawyers also noted that the House Oversight Committee, led by Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is leading several Trump-focused investigations. ""Chairman Cummings flat-out admitted that he wanted to 'investigate whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office' and 'review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities,'"" Trump's lawyers wrote in the filing. The Trump team filing came after Cummings' committee issued several subpoenas for Mazars Accounting in an effort to obtain financial documents and audits prepared for Trump and his businesses over the last decade. Cummings also sought independent auditor's reports, annual statements and other documents related to Trump's finances spanning from 2011 to 2018. At the time, Mazars said it ""will respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.""

I've said that before, and our investigation is showing that,"" the California Democrat said at a Thursday press conference. Trump continued his criticism of Pelosi in the interview, saying that the Democrats were involved in criminal behavior. ""Her party got caught spying, if you look at what happened, Hillary Clinton with the money that ultimately went to Russia for the fake dossier that total fake pile of stuff. That money gets paid   by the way the amount of money that was paid and it was paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC and went to Russia.

The NY Post also claimed that in addition to the $2.2 billion, Raven Reyes the surviving daughter of victim Andrea Pollidore, who was the 45-year-old matriarch of the family, is seeking an additional $18 million for emotional damages. Reyes filed a wrongful death claim on May 14. But she isn't the only one seeking damages. Natelle Pollidore, Andrea Pollidore's sister, wants compensation from her sister's estate for $ $37,773 to cover funeral costs, the Post reported. FDNY said the blaze was caused by an unattended stove which was not detected, as Andrea Pollidore is believed to have removed the apartment's smoke alarm. The fire trapped her and her children in two rooms in the apartment. The other victims have been identified as Pollidore's stepson Matt Abdularaph, 33, Nakaira Pollidore, 11, Andre Pollidore, 8, Brooklyn Pollidore, 6, and Elijah Pollidore, 3. Another surviving family member, Pollidore's 30-year-old son, Hakeem told the Post that, ""There are still a lot of red flags and questions we haven't had answered yet.""

"Week after debate, Biden and Harris campaigns engage in nasty Twitter feud over school busing","High-level campaign staffers for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris engaged in a fiery exchange on Twitter on Wednesday over the candidates' positions on school busing. The war of words followed the candidates' fiery exchange during last Thursday night's Democratic primary debate in Miami, when Harris challenged Biden over the issue. The face-off produced Harris' ""That little girl was me"" remark that got wide media attention. However, Harris' stance on busing isn't rock-solid, at least according to what she told reporters on Wednesday at a Democratic picnic in West Des Moines, Iowa. KAMALA HARRIS RIPS TRUMP: 'WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE' ""I think of busing as being in the toolbox of what is available and what can be used for the goal of desegregating America's schools,"" Harris said, but when pressed on whether she believes in federally mandated busing, she responded, ""I believe that any tool that is in the toolbox should be considered by a school district."" That received a sharp response from Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager and communications director. ""It's disappointing that Senator Harris chose to distort Vice President Biden's position on busing,"" Bedingfield tweeted, ""particularly now that she is tying herself in knots trying not to answer the very question she posed to him!"" That drew a reaction from Harris press secretary Ian Sams, who shot back by quoting Biden when he previously denounced busing. ""VP Biden said: 'Who the hell do we think we are that the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child?' He called busing an 'asinine concept.' C'mon. Y'all are better than this."" Then Bedingfield answered back: ""If we're cherry-picking quotes on Twitter, what about this one from this January? Sen. Harris: 'I think there are many people who would make a good president... I'm very fond of Joe Biden, so you're not gonna hear me criticize Joe Biden. I think he's a great guy.'"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""She does think he's a good guy. So do I,"" Sams responded . ""That's why a simple 'working with segregationists to stop busing 40 years ago was wrong, and I shouldn't have done it' would be welcome."" Harris has seen a major surge in the polls since her widely praised performance at last week's Democratic debate . The U.S. senator from California has jumped into third place among the two-dozen candidates seeking the Democratic Party nod in the average of polls, according to Real Clear Politics.

Buttigieg proposes national service plan to help unify the country,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg wants to dramatically increase national service opportunities to ""reignite a sense of unity in America."" The South Bend, Ind. mayor on Wednesday announced what his campaign has dubbed ""A New Call to Service."" The initiative would build a network of one million National Service members by 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of its independence. ""National service can help us to form connections between very different kinds of Americans, as was my experience in the military,"" Buttigieg said in announcing his plan. BUTTIGIEG HAULS IN $24.8 MILLION, TRIPLING FUNDRAISING Pointing to his tours of duty in Afghanistan, the 37-year-old emphasized that ""I served alongside and trusted my life to people who held totally different political views. You shouldn't have to go to war in order to have that kind of experience, which is why I am proposing a plan to create more opportunities for national service."" The proposal   which Buttigieg was scheduled to unveil later Wednesday at a Sioux City, Iowa town hall   would immediately offer national service opportunities to 250,000 positions through the existing federal and AmeriCorps grantee organizations. The program would focus on students at high schools, community colleges, vocational schools, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) as well as so-called ""opportunity youth"" (people between ages 16 and 24 who are neither in school nor working). BUTTIGIEG DROPS OUT OF TOP FOUR IN LATEST 2020 POLLS The plan would also create competitive grant funding for communities, cities and regions. And it would create new service corps, including a Climate Corps, Community Health Corps, and an Intergenerational Corps. Pointing to polls that indicate Americans' trust in institutions has never been lower, the Buttigieg campaign said the plan ""seeks to unite a new generation of American youth by mutual service and common values."" Currently, AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps offer young people opportunities to serve in low-income areas in the U.S. and abroad. Buttigieg first suggested a national service plan during an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in April. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Two rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, have also rolled out expanded national service plans over the past couple of months.

"Cal Thomas: Censoring the census citizenship question is about politics, not the law","Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. The notion of history repeating itself is usually viewed as a negative statement, but some history is worth repeating because we might learn and be guided by it. In last week's 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court rejecting the Trump administration's claim that adding a question about whether a person is a U.S. citizen was for the purpose of helping to enforce the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice John Roberts left the door open for the administration to come up with a more compelling reason. Whether this can be done in time for the 2020 Census is doubtful without an extension for document printing. The Court is on summer recess and won't re-visit the issue, if at all, until its next session. A look at history should provide reason enough to make a citizenship question part of the 2020 Census. The ultimate irony is that people employed to ask the questions must be U.S. citizens, or legal residents. Since 1820, a question about U.S. citizenship has been on census forms with few exceptions. It was left off in 1960 and 2010. Proof of citizenship is required when applying for most jobs in the country. When I travel internationally and return home, there are two lines at Immigration and Customs. One is for noncitizens and the other for citizens. A form requires me to state my citizenship and show my U.S. passport. To apply for a U.S. passport I must provide proof of citizenship. In other countries, a stamp on my passport not only limits the amount of time I am allowed to stay, but also prohibits me from employment. In the UK, I can't use the National Health Service because I am not a citizen. Other nations have a right to pass and enforce such laws. Only in America do we pass laws and then allow people to get away with ignoring them. Here, a definition might be helpful. Dictionary.com defines ""citizen"" as a person who is ""a native or naturalized member of a state or nation who owes allegiance to its government and is entitled to its protection (distinguished from alien)."" That last part ""distinguished from alien"" is key. How does one determine whether a person is an alien, or a U.S. citizen, with the entitlements and benefits that go with citizenship? By asking the question, of course. There is no right to be in America and no right to become a citizen, especially when some people break our laws to get here and then break them again to remain by failing to show up for a court hearing on the legitimacy of their asylum claims and ignoring deportation orders, which are issued after giving due process. The Trump administration says 2,000 are breaking deportation laws and avoiding forced removal from the country. President Trump says he will order ICE raids as early as next week to return them to their countries. Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and presidents Obama and Clinton, have previously supported immigration laws designed to keep immigrants out and remove those who managed to get in illegally. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A case can be made that Democrats want the citizenship question left off the 2020 form so they can import more future voters for their candidates and skewer districts to create a permanent electoral majority. Politics, not the law, has changed everything. Both parties are at fault for failing to enforce existing laws and by not reforming the broken system. It is not only a disgrace, but national suicide. If it continues, the country we inherited from our forebears will be no more. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM CAL THOMAS",politics,Fox News,right

Police probing mother and toddler's unsolved murder more than 40 years ago find bones and parts of pushchair after draining 100ft deep quarry,"Police probing the disappearance of a mother and toddler more than 40 years ago have found bones and parts of a pushchair after draining a 100ft quarry. Renee MacRae, 36, and her son Andrew, three, disappeared on November 12, 1976, from their home in Inverness, Scotland. Her bloodstained BMW was then found burnt out on the A9 around 12 miles south of the town, prompting speculation they were murdered, but their bodies were never located. Last month officers began draining the quarry at Culloden, around four miles away, and are now analysing remains they discovered to see if they are linked to Ms MacRae and her son. They pumped out almost 3million gallons of water from the quarry to be able to conduct a proper search. Ms MacRae, 36, left her home in Inverness with Andrew on November 12, 1976, heading south. Estranged from her husband, Gordon, she was driving to Perth to meet her married lover, Bill McDowell, who was Mr MacRae's accountant and Andrew's father. She had previously dropped her older son, also Gordon, then nine, with her estranged husband before setting off for Perth. Police re-examined the case in 2004 and named a suspect in a report to the procurator fiscal in 2006. However, the Crown Office said there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution. Mr McDowell, who now lives in Cumbria, was questioned by police but strongly denied having any involvement, a position he has maintained for decades. Last month a source close to the investigation said the search of the quarry was prompted by new information that came from a public appeal. The source said Police Scotland believed the searching the quarry was the 'best chance they had of solving the case'. Speaking today, Detective Inspector Brian Geddes said: 'As part of the search operation at Leanach Quarry numerous items have been found to date, many of which have warranted further research and examination. 'Meticulous analysis is now ongoing to establish if any of these items would be relevant to the investigation into the murders of Renee and Andrew MacRae.' It is believed that so far forensic teams have only identified animal parts but analysis of the skeletal remains continues. A source close to the investigation said that the pushchair wheels and metal parts appeared to be very similar to the make of buggy used by Ms MacRae. A number of cars have also been removed from the quarry. Scientists are checking material as it is pulled from the bottom of the quarry in huge shovels before lorries transfer the debris to a location off-site. There, a 16-strong team of specialist officers is carrying out a fingertip search through the mud. The operation, led by Detective Inspector Geddes, has involved personnel from the fire service and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. This month police released a picture of a Silver Cross pushchair identical to the one used by Ms MacRae. It was believed to have been with the mother and son when they went missing but has never been found. An initial search of Dalmagarry, another quarry close to where the car was recovered was quickly abandoned, despite reports from an officer that he could smell decomposing flesh. A dig at Dalmagarry lasting a month and costing £100,000 was carried out after the cold case review in 2004 but no human remains were found.",crime,Daily Mail,right
house speaker robert deleo silent over nondisclosure agreements,"House Speaker Robert DeLeo is refusing to talk publicly about the use of secret deals to settle sexual misconduct complaints, a practice roundly criticized by advocates and a state senator who says she was pressured to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a House aide. Questions remain about the pervasiveness of these confidential deals across Bay State taxpayer-funded agencies. ""Public funds should never be used to protect perpetrators and silence victims through non-disclosure agreements   period,"" state Sen. Diana DiZoglio said Thursday. ""It's a shameful practice and an outright abuse of taxpayer dollars. I want to know how much in taxpayer dollars have gone toward the abuse of NDAs (nondisclosure agreements) across our state. ""The public has the right to know how much of their hard-earned tax dollars have been spent to hide abuse, harassment and assault of powerful perpetrators,"" she added. The Methuen Democrat and state Rep. Alyson Sullivan   both self-identified survivors of sexual misconduct   are slamming DeLeo for keeping NDAs as an option in the House. The Senate unanimously banned the agreements in January. Under DiZoglio's bill, a victim of sexual harassment cannot be required to sign an NDA across state government, but can request one if they choose to do so. The legislation also bans the use of taxpayer dollars in these secret deals. ""We need to be mindful of taxpayer dollars and where those dollars are going,"" said Sullivan, an Abington Republican. ""These agreements silence someone who was victimized by sexual harassment,"" she added. ""We need to make sure they're not used anywhere, in public or private workplaces."" DeLeo's office on Thursday rejected a sit-down interview about NDAs. The speaker's office has defended the practice, but DeLeo has refused to publicly discuss it. The House protocol requires House counsel, the director of Human Resources and the Equal Employment Opportunity officer to rule out sexual harassment before entering into a NDA, according to DeLeo's office. Since 2010, there have been 33 NDAs out of the House, the speaker's office said. A spokeswoman for DeLeo said ""none"" of them were to settle complaints of sexual harassment. But DiZoglio maintains that her NDA eight years ago involved sexual harassment. NDAs shouldn't be allowed in any state agency, attorney Mitchell Garabedian reiterated Thursday. ""These help perpetuate sexual abuse,"" said the Boston lawyer, who has represented victims in clergy sexual abuse cases. ""The public should be outraged at such a notion. ""Having a NDA in government is contrary to a government being open and accessible,"" Garabedian added. ""The public has a right to know where their money is being spent."" The Massachusetts State Police do not use NDAs, said spokesman David Procopio. When asked Thursday if the governor's office hands out NDAs, spokeswoman Sarah Finlaw dodged the question. She responded: ""The Baker-Polito Administration has zero tolerance for discrimination or harassment in the workplace, and has developed a new Investigations Center of Expertise to investigate employment-related complaints across the Executive Branch in a fair and expeditious manner."" Related Articles Legislators challenge nondisclosure agreements on Beacon Hill Greg Sullivan, the Pioneer Institute's research director and former inspector general, said these settlements should not be hidden away from the public. ""It's not right for taxpayer money to be used in exchange for a NDA,"" he said. ""It's inappropriate.""",legal arguments,Fox News,right
House Oversight Committee to vote on possible Kellyanne Conway subpoena over Hatch Act controversy,"The House Oversight Committee plans to vote Wednesday on whether to subpoena White House counselor Kellyanne Conway following a government watchdog's finding that she violated the Hatch Act. In a memo sent to the White House, the committee said it ""will hold a hearing to examine the recommendation of the independent Office of Special Counsel (OSC) that President Trump remove Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway from federal service, as well as reports by OSC about Ms. Conway and other Trump Administration appointees."" The memo continued: ""The Committee also will hold a business meeting to consider a subpoena in the event that Ms. Conway does not appear."" The OSC recommended earlier in June that Conway be fired from the federal government for violating the Hatch Act on ""numerous occasions."" The Hatch Act is a federal law that limits certain political activities of federal employees. The OSC, which is separate from the office with a similar name previously run by Robert Mueller, said in a scathing report that Conway violated the Hatch Act by ""disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media. ""Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system the rule of law,"" the OSC said in a statement, noting that Conway has been a ""repeat offender."" The White House, however, has stood by Conway - calling the OSC ruling ""unprecedented"" and suggesting it was politically influenced. ""The Office of Special Counsel's (OSC) unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process. Others, of all political views, have objected to the OSC's unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves said in a statement. Groves added: ""Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations   and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.""

gascón strongly considering running for la district attorney job,"San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón on Friday said he is strongly considering running for district attorney in Los Angeles after announcing that he would not seek re-election when his term expires at the end of the year. ""This is a big decision for me and it is one I will ultimately be making in consultation with my family, but I am both proud and humbled that so many Angelinos have encouraged me to bring a data-driven vision of public safety and racial equity back to my home town of Los Angeles,"" he said in a statement Gascón is widely seen as one of the most progressive district attorneys in the country, and he has pushed statewide criminal justice reforms to lower the prison population and create more equity in a criminal justice system where people of color are starkly overrepresented . But in San Francisco, Gascón has been frequently criticized by activists groups over his decisions to not prosecute officers in fatal police shootings. Gascón has spent much of his life in Los Angeles, where he began his career in law enforcement and rose to the rank of assistant police chief. He cited his mother's ailing health as the reason he bowed out of this year's race in San Francisco. The position in Los Angeles would bring him closer to his mother. Gascón recently met with activist groups in Southern California, and he's being strongly pushed to run for the office in 2020. The groups believe he could challenge incumbent District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who was elected in 2012 as the first woman and African American to hold the position. Lacey has faced criticism for what's seen as a tough-on-crime record in a state that's been steadily moving toward reform. A recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that the Los Angeles County district attorney's office obtained death sentences for 22 defendants   all people of color   since Lacey took office. Gascón has never sought the death penalty since being appointed district attorney in 2011. The last time anyone was condemned in San Francisco was 1991. Lacey's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She has already amassed a formidable list of endorsements, which includes Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and California Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank). The state's prison population has steadily declined under Gascón-sponsored reforms like AB 109, known as ""realignment,"" and Proposition 47, which reduced certain drug and theft offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. Gascón supporters believe he could have a major impact in Los Angeles County, which has the largest jail system in the nation and the biggest prosecuting office in the state, sending people to prison more than four times the rate of San Francisco. ""While the one-size-fits-all strategy to prosecution is politically safe, in San Francisco we've proven that there are alternatives that yield better results for community safety and fairness, and that don't devastate budgets and entire generations of brown and black men,"" Gascón said. As his term in San Francisco winds down, Gascón has continued to unveil new reform measures in his office, raising speculation he had further political aspirations. In February, he announced he would scrub all of the city's marijuana convictions after California legalized recreational pot. A month later, he co-sponsored legislation that seeks to automatically wipe out eligible convictions for people who have completed local sentences. And in May, Gascón launched a website providing data on prosecutions to increase accountability. Last week, he said he will launch a new ""blind-charging"" tool that removes racial information from police reports when prosecutors decide whether to criminally charge suspects. Gascón may be seen as a progressive district attorney nationally and welcomed by activist groups in Los Angeles, but here in San Francisco he's faced strong criticism. Last year, he declined to prosecute the officers in the 2015 shooting of Mario Woods, sparking outrage in the Bayview community where Woods was killed. Every Friday, groups protest on the steps of the Hall of Justice, demanding that Gascón resign. Evan Sernoffsky is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Other leaders named on school buildings include Confederate States Army general J.E.B. Stuart, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and musician and Confederate soldier Sidney Lanier. Schools have been named after Confederate leaders since the end of the Civil War, but dozens of districts have dropped the names in the years since due to the criticism over the legacies of such leaders. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that several schools named after Robert E. Lee are renaming themselves after other famous Lees - like Adelaide Lee, an Oklahoma philanthropist.

The moves help the districts save money by not having to create brand new signs for buildings, or changing mascots, fight songs, school colors and team names. The report led several people on social media to suggest other famous ""Lees"" to name schools after, including director Spike Lee and Marvel legend Stan Lee. Sweet. Spike Lee Elementary!

Jeff Prudhomme (@PrudhommeJeff) June 24, 2019 With other Confederate leaders, schools are taking different approaches. Just last week, a school in Richmond, Virginia, changed its name from J.E.B. Stuart Elementary to Barack Obama Elementary. ""In the former capital of the Confederacy, we decided to stop honoring an individual who fought to preserve slavery - and to begin honoring our first African-American president instead,"" superintendent Jason Kamras told Yahoo Lifestyle . Kenya Gibson, a school board member in Richmond, had suggested the school be named after a local leader instead. ""Without a doubt, Barack Obama's presidency was incredible and deserves recognition,"" Gibson wrote on her Facebook page last year. ""But here in Richmond, we stand in such a unique place because of our history. We have so many local leaders that deserve recognition."" The debate over whether school names should be changes is still raging on in maybe parts of the country, with critics saying removing monuments or names is equivalent to erasing history. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , there were still 1,747 Confederate monuments still standing in 2016.

Trump says Democrats are handing out subpoenas 'like they're cookies',"President Trump said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is handing out subpoenas ""like they're cookies"" in a Fox News interview Wednesday night. The comment came in a wide-ranging interview during which he railed against the investigations into his administration and the media's treatment of his campaign. Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity Pelosi "" hands out subpoenas like they're cookies,"" while former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) was more cautious in issuing the summons. ""The Democrats fight a dirtier fight. It's too bad,"" Trump said. Democratic leaders have issued a series of subpoenas to compel the administration to release disputed documents and witness testimony, an effort the White House has fought. A s speaker of the House Pelosi does not need to approve subpoenas requests issued by committees, nor did Ryan. The president had ridiculed Democrats earlier in the day for calling his former communications director Hope Hicks in to testify behind a closed-door House Judiciary Committee meeting, saying they were putting her ""through hell."" Hicks is seen as a key witness in the investigation into potential obstruction of justice. She was mentioned 180 times in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Trump on Wednesday also repeated his claims that the Mueller report exonerated him of any wrongdoing. Mueller has said only that he found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and would not make a determination on obstruction of justice because a sitting president cannot be indicted. During his Fox News interview Trump repeatedly mentioned the size and energy of his reelection launch rally in Orlando the night before, calling it a ""tailgate party of the country."" He also said that he's not concerned about any of the 24 Democrats running in the presidential primary for a chance to beat him in 2020. ""I look at some of them, I don't see George Washington, I don't see Churchill, I don't see anybody in particular that I worry about,"" Trump said.",politics,Fox News,right
iowa workforce development manager to retire amid dispute over bureau,"A state administrator will retire after criticizing a state investigation that found she created a hostile work environment for judges who rule on unemployment benefits disputes, records show. Iowa Workforce Development has for months sought to keep secret the details of the investigation into Emily Chafa, chief of its unemployment insurance appeals bureau. Director Beth Townsend and aides have declined to answer questions or release records requested by the Associated Press, including the reason Chafa was removed from the building and paid to stay home from work for a month this spring. But records recently filed by Chafa's attorney in a disciplinary appeal show that she was placed on paid leave March 8 amid an inquiry into her workplace behavior. The investigation found Chafa treated subordinates ""disrespectfully and discourteously which has created an uncomfortable, unprofessional work environment,"" according to an April 8 letter. The letter notified Chafa she was receiving the equivalent of a three-day suspension and final warning. She was allowed to return to work but directed to make changes to how she managed the office, to ""be cognizant of the tone and volume of your voice"" and ""refrain from disparaging or demeaning remarks."" A May decision, by a state lawyer who upheld Chafa's suspension, said her subordinates overwhelmingly described negative experiences to investigators, working in an environment of fear and receiving a lack of support. They told investigators that Chafa was known to lose her temper and dress down employees in public and that they feared retaliation for questioning her, the decision said. Chafa and her attorney, Paige Fiedler, have disputed those allegations and criticized how she has been treated. They said she was escorted from the building to ""publicly shame her"" and subjected to an investigation that was designed to elicit negative information about an employee previously seen as stellar. Chafa had been the division manager since 2015, overseeing a dozen administrative law judges who rule on unemployment appeals and support staff. She was hired after a U.S. Department of Labor investigation expressed concern that judges were facing improper political pressures to rule in favor of employers and against workers seeking benefits. The department ordered that Chafa's position be part of Iowa's merit system, not a political appointment as it had been. In an April 29 letter appealing the suspension, Fiedler wrote that it was becoming increasingly difficult for Chafa to continue to shield judges from political influence. She wrote that Townsend had elevated managers ""who appear to be chosen for their personal and political loyalty rather than for any particular experience or competence related to the mission of the agency."" The appeal included Chafa's most recent performance reviews that found she exceeded expectations. One, signed by Iowa Workforce Development's deputy director in March 2018, praised Chafa's communication and teamwork and credited her with ensuring appeals were addressed within federal timelines. ""Emily has turned the Appeals Unit into one of the highest performing in the region and nationally,"" it read. Chafa, a lawyer who made $137,000 annually, has complained that the agency hasn't given specifics about her alleged inappropriate behavior. She contends that a judge filed the complaint that prompted the investigation after Chafa scolded her for failing to show up to a November appeal hearing. In a new appeal of her discipline this month, Chafa indicated that she is on an extended vacation before retiring July 11. She complained that the agency has cut off her ability to access email and her office and asked for that to be restored so she can gather her items. Townsend refused to confirm that Chafa was on leave or under investigation this spring. On April 9, the day after the investigation concluded, department lawyer Nicholas Olivencia denied AP's request for the date Chafa was removed, the notice she was given explaining why and the investigation's findings. He didn't cite any exemptions as required by the Iowa Open Records Act. Asked again, Olivencia said in a letter last month that Chafa is ""a current employee"" and declined to release records.

Myrtle the Turtle in Boston playground has to go!,"A blue tarp still lies on top of the Myrtle the Turtle so-called ""play structure"" in Beacon Hill's Myrtle Street playground   an accident waiting to happen. The city reopened the playground after the installation of the bronze sculpture without inspecting the turtle, which kids play on and have gotten burned from during hot days with the sun beating down on it. World famous local sculptor Nancy Schon created this piece of art. Her work includes the famed ""Make Way for Ducklings"" sculptures in the Public Garden as well as the ""Tortoise and the Hare"" piece in Copley Square. Concerned moms asked for a copy of the inspection after several kids were burned on it and met with the city Parks Department only to find out when the renovations were done to the playground, other items were inspected such as the trees and fences, but not the new play structure. Seems like that should have been the most important thing to ensure it complied with safety regulations, especially in a place where toddlers play. One Beacon Hill mom whose young kids play there told me, ""Our only concern with the turtle is the safety of all the children who use the playground. It was not inspected until parents put serious pressure on the city and violations were found that call for immediate action. I am shocked and disappointed by the city's decision to do nothing. The city's potential liability is significant."" Another mom who also uses the playground said, ""The metal sculpture belongs in a park as public art, not in the middle of a playground as it does not meet safety requirements for a play structure. It is a tripping hazard that interferes with the toddlers' use and enjoyment of what should be safe space to run and play. We would have liked the opportunity to raise these concerns at a Beacon Hill Architectural Commission or Boston Arts Commission hearing, but there wasn't one."" The parks commissioner who oversaw this process acknowledged the failure to have it evaluated during the inspection process. Chris Cook said, ""My preference would have been to include the turtle."" Asked if he is worried the city could be held liable if kids slip on the blue tarp and knock their front teeth out Cook responded, ""I don't think it is an unsafe … there's a sign that says don't play on it."" I reminded Cook that toddlers can't read and a blue shiny tarp could be very attractive to a young kid. All it takes is a second for a caregiver to look away and a child could be injured. This is why as parents we baby-proof our homes and why the city is supposed to inspect any piece of equipment kids are allowed to play on. But an independent inspector hired by the city after parents complained found three issues with the turtle and even wrote to ""relocate the turtle so it is not exposed to intense sun."" But it's still there. A dad said, ""The turtle is located drop dead in the middle of the playground. The heat issue is real. There are a lot of other places in Beacon Hill that would love it. If there are a bunch of people who are at the playground all the time and don't want it, it should be moved. … I hope it gets resolved."" Kate Enroth, the head of the Garden Club that raised the money for the turtle, was surprised to learn it had not been inspected before kids were allowed to play on it. ""We only wanted to do something nice for the neighborhood … it was designed in the conception with children in mind. It is all an unfortunate surprise … and I hope the parents could be more patient with the city."" But parents tend to be short on patience where their kids' safety is concerned. The city needs to acknowledge it messed up and allowed a play structure to be installed without being inspected. City Hall should listen to the parents who actually use the playground   they don't want it!",health,Boston Herald,right
Former CIA spy Valerie Plame set for Senate run as Democrat,"V alerie Plame, the former CIA officer who shot to fame when she was outed during George W. Bush's presidency, is poised to run for U.S. Senate in New Mexico. The ex-spy told the Washington Examiner on Friday that she would run as a Democrat and would ""like another opportunity to serve my country."" An early problem for Plame, 55, will be a 2017 anti-Semitism scandal. The subject will be tricky to navigate after the recent controversy involving comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar, which led to Speaker Nancy Pelosi warning of ""bigoted or dangerous ideologies masquerading as policy."" Plame was forced to apologize after sharing on Twitter an anti-Semitic article from UNZ.com entitled ""America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars."" The article stated that Jews ""own the media,"" that they should wear labels while on national television, and that their beliefs were as dangerous as ""a bottle of rat poison."" Her initial response was: ""First of all, calm down. Re-tweets don't imply endorsement. Yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish."" But she later added: ""OK folks, look, I messed up. I skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest."" She later apologized and resigned from the board of the Ploughshares Fund, which provides grants for projects aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. But in the space of three years she had posted nine UNZ articles, including one titled ""Why I Still Dislike Israel"" and another about ""Dancing Israelis"" on 9/11. Plame has been a strident critic of President Trump, launching a GoFundMe effort to buy a stake in Twitter and ban Trump from the platform. It raised $89,719 towards its $1 billion goal. She has been active in Democratic politics since moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2007, after the scandal over the leak of her identity. She hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's super PAC in 2014 and another fundraiser for Clinton's presidential campaign in 2015. Conservative columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame's identity in a 2003 column, attributing the information to ""two senior administration officials."" Plame maintains that the leak of her name was ""payback"" from the Bush administration for her then-husband, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, writing an op-ed questioning the validity of the administration's intelligence used as a basis for the Iraq War. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, former Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted in 2007 of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection to the leak of Plame's identity. It emerged that former deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage was the primary source for Novak's story, but he was never charged. Donald Trump pardoned Libby in 2018, saying that he was treated unfairly. Plame has since written three books , two spy novels and one memoir about the scandal over the leak of her name. She is now divorced from Wilson. It was her second divorce and his third. Their twin children, Trevor and Samantha, are 19. Plame's bestselling memoir Fair Game was made into a Hollywood movie of the same name in which she was played by Naomi Watts and Wilson by Sean Penn Democratic New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall announced Monday that he will not seek re-election in 2020, opening up the field in a state that leans Democrat. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., is expected to announce his candidacy next week. Democratic Secretary of State Maggie Touluse Oliver and freshman Democratic Rep. Deb Haaland said in tweets that they are also considering running for the seat. On the Republican side, businessman and former Senate candidate Mick Rich said he is thinking about jumping into the Senate race. Former Rep. Steve Pearce and former Lt. Gov.

"City Council, PWSA and the public weigh in on proposed agreement","City Council members spent the majority of Tuesday hearing input from colleagues and the public on the proposed agreement between the city and its water authority. The cooperative agreement   which requires council's approval   promises to keep the city's water system public and outlines financial responsibilities in a pact between the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and the mayor. Just six residents spoke at an evening public hearing, the majority in favor of making clear the murky relationship between the two entities. As of now, city water usage is not even metered. The agreement ""gets us a step closer to everyone in the city paying their fair share for water. The city should be paying for water,"" said Aly Shaw, Squirrel Hill resident and organizer for Pittsburgh United Our Water Our Rivers Campaign. ""You can't ask low-income ratepayers to continue to face the burden of rate increases alone."" Under the agreement, PWSA would begin phasing in a commercial customer rate for city water usage and fire hydrant service fees over the next five years. On the opposite side, PWSA would begin paying into the city's pension fund and making voluntary payroll tax contributions, something the authority was not required to do under the old agreement. ""We know we owe you at least $4.9 million [a year],"" Paul Leger, PWSA board chair, said at an earlier afternoon fact finding meeting in council chambers. ""If it's more than that, we'll pay you whatever the actuaries say it is."" Other terms mandate the city take responsibility for water lines and laterals in parks fewer than 50 acres; that PWSA be granted easements without additional council approval; and that PWSA compensate the city 50% of street sweeping costs to keep sewer grates clear. ""This is literally a daily operating manual,"" Councilwoman Deb Gross said, as opposed to current ""loosey-goosey"" arrangements. The seven council members present took turns probing the agreement at the afternoon meeting alongside Mr. Leger, PWSA Executive Director Rob Weimar, City Controller Michael Lamb and the mayor's Assistant Chief of Staff Grant Gittlen. ""Just saying you're wanting to keep it public isn't enough,"" Mr. Lamb said. Either party could terminate the agreement with 90 days' notice. Ms. Gross, who also sits on the PWSA board, said she's researching recent legislation passed in Baltimore protecting its public water system. Council members Darlene Harris and Theresa Kail-Smith, who both support keeping the utility in the public sphere, said they would like to see measures in the agreement that addressed water quality and flooding. ""To this day, I won't have a glass of PWSA water,"" Ms. Harris said, referring to the lead issues in recent years . Two of Ms. Kail-Smith's constituents approached the hearing podium holding pictures of their flooded homes in the city's Banksville neighborhood. ""On July 6, 2019, I stood alone helpless and watched my neighbors' driveways fill like a swimming pool,"" said Gina Pollice, of Hayson Avenue in Banksville, which flooded last weekend . Ms. Pollice said PWSA measures including an underground storage tank and higher curbs are not working. Ms. Kail-Smith said if PWSA is not kept public ""our residents here would have no voice whatsoever."" ""I will be discussing this issue with my colleagues before the agreement is finalized to get these residents some solutions and some answers,"" she said. Ms. Gross said council will continue public discussion. No date has been set for a vote. Council members the Rev. Ricky Burgess and Danial Lavelle were absent.

Video crew from Italy's Gelato University gets the scoop on Pittsburgh,"A video crew from Italy has stopped in Pittsburgh as part of a series on American frozen-dessert artisans and landmarks titled ""Some Like It Cold   USA Mission."" The seven-member crew, working for Carpigiani Gelato University near Bologna, Italy, spent a long Tuesday shooting at Mercurio's Pizza and Gelato's new second location in Fox Chapel. Mercurio's in Shadyside was opened in 2012 by sister and brother Anna and Michael Mercurio, whose parents started making gelato 20 years ago at Mulberry Street Creamery in Kittanning. May 13 was the last day gelato was made there; now it's all made at the Freeport Road restaurant, which is to open at the end of June. The crew and American series host Katie Butcher   she applied for this sweet gig from her home in Fort Wayne, Ind., but happens to hail from Mt. Lebanon   talked with matriarch Linda Mercurio about how the family fell in love with gelato and pizza in Italy, learned to make it together and then stayed together. Four of the Mercurios' seven adult children now own and help run the business. ""We felt very blessed that we were chosen"" to be in the series, Linda Mercurio said as four generations tried to stay out of the way of the cameras and microphones. Despite how busy they've been getting the new location open, too, ""It's so much fun"" to do the video. ""Give me the best light possible,"" she quipped between takes. The best part was the crew talking and arguing in Italian, which Mrs. Mercurio understands down to the hand gesture. ""Silence please!"" ordered assistant director Elita Montini before she clapped the clapperboard for the first take of Linda Mercurio and her oldest daughter, Lisa, showing how they make lemon sorbetto. ""And, ACTION!"" added director Aldo Innocenti, who sounded and looked just like an Italian film director should as he stopped and made them reshoot the scene. When they nailed it, he praised, ""BELLISIMO!"" What he wants to create, he said in his delightful accent, is ""a small, small movie about people who changed their lives through gelato and ice cream."" Actually, eight small movies. The crew hit New York City on the first week of June. The first stops were to interview Jon Snyder from the Laboratorio del Gelato in Manhattan, Malcolm Livingston from 36 Brix by Ghetto Gastro in the Bronx and then Dino Russo from Uncle Louie G's in Staten Island. Then the crew headed to John Fezzuoglio from Owowcow in Ottsville in Bucks County, Pa., before heading to Pittsburgh. After shooting more here Wednesday, the crew's big white van also is stopping in Lafayette, Ind.; Appleton, Wis.; and Minneapolis, where their trip is to end June 30. The series episodes   subtitled ""Searching for the secret of happiness""   are to be ready around August to post, every two weeks or so, on Gelato University's YouTube channel and its Facebook page , where photos from the trip are being posted along with a video series trailer. Carpagiani, which makes gelato and ice cream machines, started its school in 2003 and now has a dozen campuses around the world to spread the frozen dessert gospel. Ms. Montini will have tons of editing to do, but everybody seemed sure that we'll be seeing Linda Mercurio's money-shot answer to the question, ""What's gelato mean to you?"" After patiently waiting for the crew to get the hot lights and angles just right, she said, ""Gelato was my eighth baby."" She teared up a little, again, and the director gave her hugs.

Police probing mother and toddler's unsolved murder more than 40 years ago find bones and parts of pushchair after draining 100ft deep quarry,"Police probing the disappearance of a mother and toddler more than 40 years ago have found bones and parts of a pushchair after draining a 100ft quarry. Renee MacRae, 36, and her son Andrew, three, disappeared on November 12, 1976, from their home in Inverness, Scotland. Her bloodstained BMW was then found burnt out on the A9 around 12 miles south of the town, prompting speculation they were murdered, but their bodies were never located. Last month officers began draining the quarry at Culloden, around four miles away, and are now analysing remains they discovered to see if they are linked to Ms MacRae and her son. They pumped out almost 3million gallons of water from the quarry to be able to conduct a proper search. Ms MacRae, 36, left her home in Inverness with Andrew on November 12, 1976, heading south. Estranged from her husband, Gordon, she was driving to Perth to meet her married lover, Bill McDowell, who was Mr MacRae's accountant and Andrew's father. She had previously dropped her older son, also Gordon, then nine, with her estranged husband before setting off for Perth. Police re-examined the case in 2004 and named a suspect in a report to the procurator fiscal in 2006. However, the Crown Office said there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution. Mr McDowell, who now lives in Cumbria, was questioned by police but strongly denied having any involvement, a position he has maintained for decades. Last month a source close to the investigation said the search of the quarry was prompted by new information that came from a public appeal. The source said Police Scotland believed the searching the quarry was the 'best chance they had of solving the case'. Speaking today, Detective Inspector Brian Geddes said: 'As part of the search operation at Leanach Quarry numerous items have been found to date, many of which have warranted further research and examination. 'Meticulous analysis is now ongoing to establish if any of these items would be relevant to the investigation into the murders of Renee and Andrew MacRae.' It is believed that so far forensic teams have only identified animal parts but analysis of the skeletal remains continues. A source close to the investigation said that the pushchair wheels and metal parts appeared to be very similar to the make of buggy used by Ms MacRae. A number of cars have also been removed from the quarry. Scientists are checking material as it is pulled from the bottom of the quarry in huge shovels before lorries transfer the debris to a location off-site. There, a 16-strong team of specialist officers is carrying out a fingertip search through the mud. The operation, led by Detective Inspector Geddes, has involved personnel from the fire service and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. This month police released a picture of a Silver Cross pushchair identical to the one used by Ms MacRae. It was believed to have been with the mother and son when they went missing but has never been found. An initial search of Dalmagarry, another quarry close to where the car was recovered was quickly abandoned, despite reports from an officer that he could smell decomposing flesh. A dig at Dalmagarry lasting a month and costing £100,000 was carried out after the cold case review in 2004 but no human remains were found.",crime,Daily Mail,right
Massport won't say who they're looking at for next chief,"The super-secret search for a new Massport CEO may come down to a familiar refrain: Who has the most political connections. It's actually buried in the fine print of the job invitation put out by Massport's search firm- the phrase is ""political astuteness."" ""Experience working effectively with elected and appointed officials"" is one of the key job requirements, according to Massport. ""Preference will be given to candidates with such experience in Massachusetts."" That means Massport is unlikely to go with an outsider   say, an airport director from another state. But because Massport has chosen to keep its search secret, we'll never know what qualifications tip the scales in favor of the winning contender. That's a mistake that could come back to haunt the agency. Massport is a ""public entity, serving public missions that enhance the quality of life for the residents of the region."" That language is lifted from Massport's own invitation to job seekers. A public agency with one of the most powerful positions in state government should not be guided by a private search led by board members who refuse to give the public a glimpse of their decision-making process. So far. we have only hints, gleaned from the job description. Like this one: ""While transportation, aviation, port and/or multi-modal experience is a distinct plus, it is not a requirement for consideration."" In other words, you don't need experience running an airport or large transportation agency. According to past reports and sources close to Massport, the final list of candidates includes former Boston state rep Brian Golden, who now runs the Boston Planning and Development Agency, formerly known as the BRA. Golden certainly has the required political acumen, but if he gets the nod Massport will be criticized for going with yet another white male. Other finalists could be the insider candidate, Lisa Wieland, who is now Massport's port director. Sources said she has the support of state Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack, who is leading Massport's CEO search. Here's another surprise name to watch: Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll, who two sources said has been under consideration. Driscoll is a Democrat, which is a check mark against her. But she's also a big supporter of Gov. Charlie Baker, which is a big check mark in her favor.

Trial begins in 2017 Plum double-fatal crash,"An Indiana County man was driving with a potentially lethal level of fentanyl in his blood when he crashed head-on into another vehicle in Plum and killed two people in 2017, according to testimony Monday. Edward Cass III, 27, of Saltsburg, is on trial in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court this week on charges of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence and related counts. He is accused of killing the driver of the car he struck on Route 286, Beth Ann Beveridge, 43, and the rear-seat passenger, Michael Zier, 17, both of Tarentum. Charges also include having injured Ms. Beveridge's daughter, Libbie Beveridge, who was the front-seat passenger. Michael was Libbie's boyfriend. Ms. Beveridge was driving outbound on Golden Mile Highway/Route 286 about 10 p.m. on Aug. 6, 2017, near Pine Valley Plaza, when her car was struck head-on by Mr. Cass, who was driving a blue Toyota sedan. Two men who were passing by the scene that evening testified that they helped get both Michael and Libbie out of the car. One of the men, Frank Benson, testified that he looked inside the defendant's car and ""there were pill bottles in the vehicle all over the floor."" During the nonjury trial Monday before Judge David R. Cashman, Jennifer Janssen, the manager of the toxicology section of the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office, testified that Mr. Cass had 8.9 nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood in his system about two hours after the crash. ""It's double the therapeutic range,"" she said. ""I have seen levels that high in our post-mortem cases."" Mr. Cass, she said, also had marijuana in his system   consistent with recent use. Typically, Ms. Janssen said, the active ingredient in marijuana peaks in the blood about 10 minutes after smoking and dissipates to undetectable levels within two hours. Plum police Officer Nicholas Iachini testified that he spoke to the defendant the night of the crash, and Mr. Cass told him he was sober, and that he had looked down to change the radio station when the crash occurred. But Allegheny County homicide Detective Mark Restori testified that Mr. Cass was traveling in the wrong lane, heading toward Ms. Beveridge for at least 300 to 400 feet prior to impact. In addition, according to the car's event data recorder, which operates like an airplane's black box, he turned his steering wheel sharply, to a 75-degree angle, back to the right at the time of impact. Mr. Cass' vehicle was traveling at 49 mph five seconds before the crash. Ms. Beveridge's vehicle was moving 45 mph five seconds before. The impact of the crash obliterated the front ends of both cars. Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey repeatedly asked the prosecution's witnesses if Beth Beveridge or Michael were wearing their seat belts at the time of impact. Detective Restori said they were not. Mr. Thomassey argued to Judge Cashman that whether they were wearing their seat belts is relevant to causation in their deaths. ""Everybody probably would have survived if they had been strapped,"" he said. Libbie Beveridge testified that her mother never wore her seat belt. ""She always told me it was a 50/50 chance,"" Libbie Beveridge testified. She told Judge Cashman that she noticed bright headlights in their travel lane a few seconds before the crash and warned her mother that the car was going to hit them. Her mother responded, ""'No, it's not.'"" ""My mom looked over and said, 'I love you,' and that was the last thing.""

Crowd at Schenley Plaza watches live as U.S. women win World Cup,"For 60 scoreless minutes, the tension kept mounting among the hundreds of fans in Schenley Plaza watching the U.S. women's soccer team facing off against the Netherlands Sunday in the final of the Women's World Cup. The crowd gathering in front of a big screen in Oakland held its breath as the Netherlands took shots at the American goal, and groaned as the U.S. women failed to capitalize on their first few chances. Finally, in the match's 61st minute, the tension broke, in the form of a penalty kick by star striker Megan Rapinoe. The cheers that erupted then were happy but a bit muted, more relieved than celebratory. It wasn't until eight minutes later, when U.S. forward Rose Lavelle wove past the Dutch defense to notch a second goal, that the crowd of about 400 really let loose   flags waved, couples kissed, parents tossed their toddlers high in the air. It wouldn't be long before the attendees, largely families with young children, nearly all clad in red, white and blue, watched as the final whistle blew and the American squad hoisted their fourth trophy. Though the gender split at Schenley seemed about even, the young girls in the crowd seemed to be watching the U.S. squad with a special reverence. ""I like Rapinoe, 'cause she can score,"" said Milena Poziviak, 10, of McKeesport, sporting a team jersey and red, white and blue lip gloss that she'd had applied at a nearby tent.

(Jessie Wardarski/Post-Gazette) To parents like Kim Neely, who had been watching every game of the tournament at home in Garfield with her two boys, Jordan, 9, and Kenneth, 5, the event was a chance to show her sons how many others in Pittsburgh were cheering on the team. ""I thought it would be good for my boys to come out here and see the excitement that the city has, celebrating women's sports,"" she said. ""I wanted them to understand that women's sports are just as important as men's sports, and they seem to be embracing that."" Sticking out like sore thumbs in the sea of American fans were the bright orange jerseys of about a dozen brave supporters of the Dutch side. Kai Tuk, who moved to Shadyside about two years ago from the Netherlands, said he'd heard that there were big-screen watch parties all over his home country, much like the one at Schenley. ""They'll be filled with orange   not like the minority we are here today,"" he said. Enthusiastic as the crowd was, it wasn't exactly raucous. Many clapped respectfully as the Dutch goalie made some especially impressive saves. A rowdier crew could be found across town at Piper's Pub in the South Side, which reached capacity by 10 a.m. and had to start turning people away more than an hour before the match began. Some fans who couldn't get into the bars ended up at Schenley Sunday afternoon. For others, the big screen in the park was a more appealing option to begin with. ""I didn't want to be at a bar at 11 in the morning,"" said Elysar Naja, 26, of North Versailles. The dark clouds overhead didn't burst until the 73rd minute, when rain began to fall on the plaza. But the crowd didn't thin   those who didn't have umbrellas or raincoats just draped themselves in their American flags and waited for the final whistle. It was a long-awaited victory by a team that's been celebrated not only for its exceptional on-field talent, but for its players' infectious confidence and their ongoing demand to be paid as much as their male counterparts. ""It was a huge woman power moment,"" said Kelsey Calamaro, 21, a student at Chatham University, who has followed the U.S. women's team since she started playing soccer at the age of 4. ""The Netherlands in the first half definitely had them defensively. But USA came out strong   they're the queens!"" Nick Garber: ngarber@post-gazette.com",sports,Post-Gazette,right
RMV probe turns to violations the state was obliged to send,"Gov. Charlie Baker is acknowledging a ""complete failure"" at the Registry of Motor Vehicles, adding the investigation will now include a look into Massachusetts' notifications to other states about violations here   while watchdogs say audits could reveal deeper failures. ""That's part of the review and I'm uncomfortable speaking to it beyond that at this point,"" Baker said of what other states may or may not have been told. ""I view what happened at the RMV as a complete failure,"" Baker said Tuesday. State Rep. Shaunna O'Connell said she was rebuffed by the Registry of Motor Vehicles in her recent attempts to have a full audit that would look into illegal immigrants using fraudulent identities after a series of arrests of drug dealers and other criminals. The Taunton Republican said she plans to call for a further hearing to haul the RMV brass in front of the oversight committee on the issue, and she wants to push further for her bill that would order a full audit. ""A full audit of the RMV database will uncover other problems people aren't aware of,"" O'Connell said Tuesday. ""Once you scratch the surface, who knows what will blow up?"" O'Connell added, ""It's scary to think what other problems could be happening. People aren't doing their jobs, and it starts with leadership."" Her criticism comes a day after Baker and Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack outlined the series of problems uncovered in the aftermath of the RMV's failure to suspend the license of trucker Volodymyr Zhukovskyy following an out-of-state drunken-driving arrest that happened a month before he was criminally charged with killing seven bikers in New Hampshire in a car crash June 21. Following RMV chief Erin Deveney's resignation last week after the fatal crash, Baker and Pollack have pointed to two different areas in which the RMV dropped the ball on notifications about out-of-state violations   which both contributed to allowing the 23-year-old West Springfield man to remain on the road. No RMV employees were doing the manual checks needed on commercial driver's license violations from out of state, and the tens of thousands of notices for infractions on regular Massachusetts licenses from other states had also ended up unchecked, stashed away in 53 bins of paper. Former State Inspector General Greg Sullivan said the failings revealed so far are ""indicative of broader problems"" at the RMV. ""What else isn't being done? That represents a very serious problem,"" Sullivan said. ""You're talking about life and safety of the general public."" James Scott, a Saugus police officer who has trained more than 1,700 officers across New England and beyond in detecting fraudulent identities, said the RMV has had no interest in taking on his program that other states such as New Hampshire use to track fraudulent identities, like O'Connell was talking about. ""I've pitched it directly to the registrar at the State House about a year and a half ago,"" Scott told the Herald. ""They wanted no part of it."" State Rep. Paul Tucker supports O'Connell's idea of a broader audit, saying now's the time to push for one that also includes a look into people who have multiple licenses. ""Why not do a top-to-bottom review and see what comes of it?"" the Salem Democrat said. ""It's pretty clear that when there's bins of these notices that are sitting somewhere that there are issues.""",politics,Boston Herald,right
"No, Joe Biden, President Trump is not 'an existential threat to America'","Editor's note: The opinions in this article are the author's, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. Wages are rising, unemployment is at record lows, and the economy is booming. But if you ask Joe Biden, the world might end tomorrow unless we toss President Trump out of office. In a Tuesday afternoon stump speech in Iowa, the supposedly moderate 2020 candidate is set to paint a bleak vision of life under Trump. In his prepared remarks, Biden says that ""Trump is an existential threat to America"" and that he hopes ""we choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Truth over lies. And science over fiction."" This likely won't resonate with voters. In the eyes of sane people, the last two years of the Trump presidency have been full of ups and downs, but it's been far from the nightmare scenario Biden describes. Almost 60% of Americans, whether they personally approve of Trump or not, approve of his handling of the economy. And almost half either approve of Trump's performance as president or have no opinion. You'd expect an ""existential threat"" to generate a broader resistance, not just a louder one. The alarmist rhetoric distracts from Biden's actual message. After all, does anyone really know what his candidacy stands for? He launched his campaign by bashing Trump, and since then, he has rambled on incessantly about the Oval Office's current occupant, describing this election as a battle for ""the soul of the nation"" and saying the president is a ""threat to this nation, to our democracy."" Give me a break. If you want to be president of the United States, you're probably going to need a more compelling pitch than ""pick me, I'm not that guy."" Still, it's worth engaging with the apocalyptic argument that Trump's presidency poses a threat to America, even if it's absurd when taken at face value. Is it that Trump's climate policy will doom us to death by global warming? This is quite the stretch. Trump has exited a voluntary climate agreement and rolled back a few environmental policies, but U.S. emissions fell in his first year in office   the last one for which we have data. Besides, many states such as Pennsylvania and Oregon are taking their own initiatives to decrease carbon emissions, and the global climate crisis is really driven by emissions in developing countries such as India anyway. Or is it that President Trump is a buffoon with the nuclear codes, who will drag us into a war? So far, he's done more to end wars (in Afghanistan and Syria) than start them. Also, his record in North Korea might be a mixed bag, but on balance, he has succeeded in de-escalating very high tensions. But surely, as Biden says, Trump is a threat to our democracy who won't accept the result of our elections? That certainly doesn't seem to be the case, as the GOP suffered landslide losses in 2018 that went into effect without a hitch, and the president allowed an entire investigation into his campaign to reach completion without firing special counsel Robert Mueller or otherwise shutting it down. This is the great flaw with Biden's   and, to a lesser extent, the other 2020 Democrats'   approach rooted in Trump-alarmism. There's a portion of American voters that may always swear by Trump, and another base that might hate him no matter what. But many reasonable people are open to criticism of the president, be it of his foolish trade policy, his overly harsh immigration stances, or the multiple outlandish or offensive things he's said (or tweeted) since taking office. When criticism of Trump becomes extreme and overblown, as Biden's often has been, those of us in touch with reality may start to tune out. For now, Biden is still beating Trump in most head-to-head polls. If he wants that to continue, Biden should stand for something   not just against someone.",politics,Washington Examiner,right
"RMV Fail: 546 license suspensions, more to come","The Registry of Motor Vehicles let tens of thousands of alerts on Massachusetts drivers' violations in other states accumulate for more than a year, unprocessed in 53 bins, in a deadly bureaucratic failure that Gov. Charlie Baker admits has tested public confidence in his administration. In a stunning press conference detailing the scope of the crisis Monday, Baker and Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack laid out the registry's failures revealing no one at the RMV was doing the required manual checks on license infractions from out of state   a backlog dating to March 2018. ""No registry employees had been tasked with the job of monitoring that queue,"" Pollack said. That backlog included West Springfield trucker Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, accused of killing seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire on June 21, despite a Connecticut OUI arrest on May 11 that should have triggered an automatic license suspension. As of Monday, a total of 546 drivers have now been suspended based on previously overlooked out-of-state notices. When asked about how people could trust his administration's transportation management after major failings at the RMV and MBTA, Baker replied, ""We have a lot of work to do to earn back some of that."" Pollack, when asked whether she intended to resign as RMV chief Erin Deveney did last week, told reporters, ""The governor has asked me to fix this, and I'm going to fix it."" Baker said he has launched an independent audit of the Registry of Motor Vehicles with findings due in 60 days. More suspensions are expected as officials go through tens of thousands of out-of-state notices that were filed and forgotten in 53 bins in the RMV's Quincy headquarters. ""The RMV failed to act on critically important information that had been previously communicated by another state,"" Baker said. ""This failure is completely unacceptable to me, to the residents of the commonwealth who expect the RMV to do its job and track drivers' records."" Pollack said the responsibilities for the state-to-state communications shuffled around within the registry   and ultimately fell by the wayside in March 2018, for some unknown reason, when people stopped dealing with the notifications altogether. Pollack said the RMV has ""worked around the clock"" to address the backlog. Acting Registrar Jamey Tesler is heading the internal scrub. Most of the paper notifications are moving violations that would not automatically lead to suspension, Pollack added, but work is ongoing to find violations that might warrant suspension. There was no information available about whether any of those drivers who shouldn't have been on the road have been involved in any crashes. Baker said the secretary and acting registrar have taken some ""immediate steps"" to address the failure by establishing a new process to implement same-day processing of new out-of-state violations and establishing a dashboard so that registry managers have the information available in ""real-time."" Related Articles Timeline of the RMV's fatal failure Lawyers: State could be sued for letting dangerous drivers stay on the road Sorry Charlie, your third-term dream just collided with the RMV Jarheads leader slams RMV; 'Someone's dropping the ball' Investigation reveals thousands of notifications awaiting review at RMV; outside audit planned Pollack said an initial review of the state's 115,000 commercial licenses in the system will be expanded to include all of the roughly 5.2 million licensed drivers in the state, which would run them all directly against the national databases. MassDOT officials wouldn't say whether any RMV employees have been disciplined for the deadly oversight or why the out-of-state violation responsibilities had moved around within different RMV offices, and was ultimately abandoned. House Speaker Robert DeLeo said he is waiting to see whether the Legislature needs to act. ""We're anxiously awaiting to see exactly where there may have been a failure in the system,"" DeLeo said. ""Once we have more of the information, as provided by some of the initial investigations, I think we'll be in a better place to decide.""",legal arguments,Boston Herald,right
"Woodland Hills teen on his busy senior year: 'I wouldn't ask for anything more, anything less'","L ast fall, Rasaun Brown took on a swollen schedule that made his senior year at Woodland Hills High School race by in a blur. Boxing. Clothes design. Auto-mechanic training. Hanging out with friends   they're ""family,"" he said. What started as a range of open-ended possibilities in his last year of high school became a trove of poignant memories for the soft-spoken, style-savvy teen. He described it in one word: ""fantastic."" ""I loved my senior year,"" Rasaun said. ""Some of the best things happened this school year. The greatest things. I wouldn't ask for anything more, anything less."" At the homecoming dance last September, he sported sunglasses, a black bow-tie and a slick tiger-striped jacket in black and cerulean blue   a nod to the school colors. He landed a spot on the homecoming court, one most memorable moments of his adolescence, validation that he was ""one of the leaders of the school,"" he said. In the afternoons and evenings, Rasaun shone as a local amateur boxer, quick with his hands, loaded with stamina and sharp with his right-hook. He flashed enough potential   including a championship knockout in November   that he wants a shot at the next level, to figure out if his hands can punch professionally.

""Cash Flow Clothing,"" the fashion brand he founded his freshman year through his work at the Braddock Youth Project, took a back seat last December after his schedule proved too busy to keep up with filling orders and churning out new designs. It's just dormant, not dead, he said. ""Next December,"" Rasaun said, ""I'm going to come back with more designs, more models, more shoots, more collaborative stuff with Cash Flow. I'm coming harder than ever."" He acknowledged that part of the setback stemmed from a bout of senioritis, the teenage endemic that afflicts countless students who sense the end of school is near. Repairing cars is the road map for now. In August, Rasaun plans to start a 16-month automotive training program at Rosedale Technical College, a continuation of his work at the Forbes Road Career and Technology Center in Monroeville, where he trained several hours each school day. He's handy with tools, just like his dad. To help pay for it, Rasaun last month received a scholarship named in honor of Jerame Turner, a former classmate, who was killed in 2017. This summer, he plans to work with kids at summer camp hosted at the Nyia Page Community Center in Braddock. He is set to lead a group called the ""Fashion Design Team"" and already has a project in mind, one that involves the artistic chops he picked up there when he was a kid like them.

"County Council Democrats interview 12 candidates for District 8 vacancy, ahead of Tuesday vote","In a marathon session Monday, Allegheny County Council's Democratic caucus interviewed 12 candidates to serve as the interim council member for District 8, a seat that opened in May with the death of longtime Councilman Charles Martoni. The district covers Plum, Monroeville and 15 smaller Mon Valley communities. According to county rules, an interim member should be appointed from Mr. Martoni's Democratic Party by Tuesday. The person will serve until the Nov. 5 general election, when a replacement will be chosen to serve the remainder of Mr. Martoni's term, through 2021. Mr. Martoni died May 19. Council President John DeFazio, the Democratic caucus chair, will nominate a candidate for council to vote on at Tuesday's regular council meeting. Local party committees will select a candidate for November's general election. The 12 candidates included municipal officials and employees, local party committee members and activists. Council members mostly asked general questions about what candidates saw as their potential role on council, but Councilman DeWitt Walton had a litmus test that he asked every candidate about: whether they would vote for his legislation to create a county-wide civilian police review board . The candidates interviewed were: Shawn Alfonso Wells, of Swissvale, an anthropologist who teaches at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.

conservation groups ask gov. evers to veto proposed cwd deer farm study,"Six Wisconsin conservation groups have joined in an effort to get Gov. Tony Evers to veto a provision in the Republican-supported state budget for a deer farm study of chronic wasting disease. At issue: The measure would take $100,000 from hunter-supplied fees earmarked for CWD testing of hunter-killed deer and instead use it to help pay for the captive deer research. ""(We) are not opposing the Legislature's funding of the domestic deer farm CWD study, however we strongly oppose that sportsmen and women's dollars are being used to fund the study,"" the organizations wrote in a June 20 letter to Evers. The letter is signed by the Wisconsin Conservation Congress, Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, Wisconsin Bowhunters Association, Wisconsin chapter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, the Buffalo County Conservation Alliance and the Mondovi Conservation Club. The organizations cumulatively represent more than 200 sports groups and thousands of Wisconsin hunters, anglers and trappers, according to the letter. On June 19, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the proposal, which was introduced June 13 at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance. All 12 Republicans on the committee voted in favor of the measure and all four Democrats opposed it. It later passed the Republican-controlled Assembly and Senate and now awaits Evers' signature or veto. The proposal would cost about $150,000 a year and run for three years, according to Laurie Seale, vice president of Whitetails of Wisconsin, the state's captive deer group. The balance of the funding would come from deer farmers or donors, Seale said. The contested $100,000 portion of the funding would be taken from a Department of Natural Resources conservation account funded by hunters who purchase bonus antlerless deer permits. The money, $5 from each permit sold in CWD-affected counties, is ear-marked for CWD testing and monitoring. The primary objective of the deer farm proposal is to study genetic resistance in white-tailed deer to CWD, an always fatal disease found in deer, elk and related species. Past research has shown certain genotypes of deer live longer than others before succumbing to the disease. Deer with two of the resistant genotypes are likely to live about eight months longer than other deer before dying of the disease, according to Mike Samuel, UW-Madison professor emeritus. The extra lifespan provides the potential to produce more offspring, but also the potential to spread the disease to more deer. Deer farmers have shown keen interest in research on CWD resistance, hoping findings could help them selectively breed animals with longer lifespans even in the presence of the disease. According to the research proposal, it would evaluate the health and CWD susceptibility of genetically resistant animals; challenge deer with CWD to determine their resistance; determine when animals start to shed prions; and continue the development of live animal tests for CWD, including evaluating rectal biopsies, blood, saliva and feces for the presence of CWD prions. The work would take place at Windy Ridge Whitetails in Mineral Point, a CWD-positive deer farm that was depopulated in 2018. The facility is double-fenced and previously held white-tailed deer. Evers has until Friday to take action on the budget, although sources in Madison indicate he is likely to do so before the July 4th holiday. Our subscribers make this coverage possible.

"totowa nj quickchek killing started with road rage, witness says","PATERSON   The fatal stabbing of former Paterson Catholic football star Justin Parker at a Totowa QuickChek last year was the bloody conclusion to a road rage incident that occurred just minutes before, his friend testified on Tuesday. James Pittman took the witness stand as the murder trial of Damien Edwards resumed after a two-week recess. The jury spent most of the day looking at store surveillance video of an angry confrontation in the QuickChek parking lot between Edwards, Parker and Pittman around 3 a.m. on May 20, 2018, which escalated to the brawl that left Parker with fatal stab wounds just inside the front door. Pittman told the jury that he and Parker had been drinking that night, then decided to take a ride to QuickChek on Union Boulevard, just over the Paterson line. The two men hopped into separate cars   Parker in a silver Audi and Pittman in a red Toyota   but trouble erupted just before they got to the store, Pittman said. Under questioning by Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Fetterman, Pittman testified that he nearly collided with a black SUV driven by Edwards as he turned off Chamberlain Avenue and onto Union Boulevard. Windows were rolled down and angry words were exchanged as the two vehicles drove side by side down Union Boulevard toward the QuickChek entrance, Pittman said. ""It was, like, 'Mother [expletive], can't you drive?' "" Pittman said of the exchange with Edwards. In the front seat with Edwards was his girlfriend, and in the back seat was the couple's 8-year-old daughter. Surveillance video shows Pittman's Toyota and Edwards' SUV entering the QuickChek parking lot side by side, which both sides contend is evidence that the war of words was escalating. Parker's Audi, meanwhile, pulls into a spot on the other side of the parking lot. Moments later, the video camera picks up Parker and Edwards grappling on the floor of the QuickChek, arms flailing. Pittman, who was not involved in the fight, broke down on the witness stand as he recounted how his friend bled to death on the floor of the convenience store. Meagan Akins, an on-duty Totowa police officer who was in the store at the time, previously testified that she saw the two men fighting by the front door, but never saw a knife. She saw one of the assailants run toward the black SUV, then jumped in her patrol car and stopped the vehicle just after it left the parking lot. Edwards was not in the vehicle, but his girlfriend was behind the wheel. Edwards was arrested later that morning at his home in Totowa, about three blocks from the QuickChek. A bloody knife, which was later tested and found to have Parker's DNA on the blade, was recovered from the backyard. Edwards, 34, is charged with murder in the first degree, which is punishable by up to life in prison, and weapons offenses. He has been held in the Passaic County Jail since his arrest. The prosecution contends Edwards was carrying a knife and made the conscious decision to use it against Parker, who was 35 years old. The defense counters that with the road rage incident having spilled over into the parking lot, Edwards was defending himself, his girlfriend and their child. During cross-examination, defense attorney Paul Condon made much of the fact that Pittman had been drinking that night. He also tried to poke holes in Pittman's original statement to Paterson police, in which he claimed to have been blinded by another car's headlights as he sought to enter the QuickChek lot. Condon replayed the video to show the jury there was no car in the parking lot at the time. ""You lied to police, didn't you?"" Condon demanded. Pittman said he told the truth. Then Condon pounced on Pittman's testimony that he'd been drinking wine and then whiskey that night. ""I was drinking, but I wasn't drunk,"" Pittman insisted. Pittman is expected back on the witness stand for further cross-examination when the trial continues Wednesday.

former port richey mayor found guilty of obstruction,"NEW PORT RICHEY, FL -- Former Port Richey Mayor Dale Massad wanted a speedy trial, and he got his wish. On Tuesday, after one day of testimony, a jury found Massad guilty of conspiracy to corrupt justice and misusing a two-way communication device. This is the first of two trials the former doctor and one-time politician is facing. He is charged with attempted murder after being accused of firing on a Pasco County Sheriff's SWAT Team that was attempting to serve him with a Florida Department of Law Enforcement warrant at his home for practicing medicine without a license. The second trial date has not been set. Massad, 68, has been held at the Land O' Lakes Detention Center without bond since his arrest Feb. 21. That's where prosecutors say he conspired to obstruct justice during a jailhouse phone call to city councilman Terrance Rowe, who stepped in as acting mayor when Massad was arrested. Both Rowe and Massad were later suspended from office by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. During the jailhouse call, which was recorded, prosecutors said Massad and Rowe discussed discrediting a Port Richey Police officer who participated in an undercover investigation into Massad, who was accused of providing medical treatment at his home without a license. Massad's attorney, Denis deVlaming, attempted to suppress portions of the phone call between Massad and Rowe. However, Circuit Court Judge Mary Handsel ruled that the jury needed to hear most of the conversation to understand what led up to the charges. She did agree to redact any mention of the premeditated attempted homicide charges against Massad. Jurors also heard from Port Richey Police Officer Donald Howard, the subject of the jailhouse phone call. Howard went undercover, posing as a patient needing Massad's services. Howard told the jury he was alarmed when he heard the jailhouse recording in which Massad directed Rowe to do ""anything you can do"" to discredit Howard. Port Richey City Manager Vince Lupo also testified that Rowe went against procedure when he requested police department personnel records from the city clerk rather than from him. In the meantime, newly elected Port Richey Mayor Scott Tremblay presided at his first city council meeting on Tuesday since his election June 18. Tremblay won by eight votes over runner-up Bill Colombo with a total of 565 Port Richey residents voting in the special election. The council is currently made up of Tremblay, William Dittmer, who was appointed vice mayor, and councilwoman Jennie Sorrell. Although he can't participate in council meetings due to his suspension from office by the governor, Rowe has not resigned from office. Port Richey residents are in the midst of a second round of petitions to have Rowe removed from his council seat. A first round of signatures to recall Rowe was validated by the Pasco County Supervisor of Elections office May 6. Petitioners have until July 19 to gather the additional round of signatures to recall Rowe. Petitioners must gather signatures from 15 percent of the voters   of 269 voters   for the second round.

The enthusiasm across the country for this President is unmatched and unlike anything we've ever seen! #trump2020 #KeepAmericaGreat,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted early Wednesday. The president tweeted ""THANK YOU!"" in response. TRUMP LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN MACHINE WITH MASSIVE WAR CHEST, DESPITE POLLING LAG According to an RNC spokesman, the fundraising - at a clip of $1 million an hour - came through the Trump re-election campaign and joint-fundraising committees Trump Victory and Trump MAGAC (Make America Great Again Committee). Minutes later, RNC Communications Director Michael Ahrens tweeted: ""For those keeping score, that's more than the 5 highest polling Democrats   combined."" Ahrens was referring to the top five polling Democratic candidates' fundraising during the 24 hours after they announced their presidential bids. Among them, former Vice President Joe Biden raked in $6.3 million and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brought in $5.9 million, with the others raising significantly less than that. But none of the candidates hit $20 million even in the first quarter. Sanders brought in $18.2 million in the first 41 days of his campaign; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., brought in $12 million during the first three months of this year; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas raised $9.4 million; and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $7.1 million. Democratic presidential primary front-runner Biden, who announced after the first quarter, hinted this week at raising roughly $20 million so far, as he tours the fundraising circuit with a series of top-dollar events. But the Trump campaign re-launch surpassed that in 24 hours, counting various fundraising committees, coinciding with his energetic rally in Orlando to a packed arena crowd. The fundraising numbers underscore what has, since before the Democratic candidates even started campaigning, been a huge cash advantage for the incumbent. Going into Trump's rally on Tuesday, the re-election campaign had $40.8 million in cash-on-hand at the start of second-quarter fundraising on April 1. Combined with the RNC's joint fundraising committees, they have a combined $82 million cash-on-hand for the second quarter. AMID ATTACKS FROM RIVALS, BIDEN HOLDS TOP-DOLLAR FUNDRAISERS AND HINTS AT $20M HAUL But despite Trump's massive war chest, the latest Fox News Poll shows Biden topping the president by 10 points and Sanders ahead of the president by 9 points. But Trump's campaign and the president himself have dismissed recent polling. ""Our country is soaring to incredible new heights,"" Trump said Tuesday night, to loud applause. ""Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country, and as long as you keep this team in place - we have a tremendous way to go - our future has never, ever looked brighter or sharper."" Trump continued: ""The fact is, the American Dream is back. It's bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.""

lapd targets possible ms-13 presence in the valley with early morning raids,"Early Wednesday, Los Angeles police went throughout the San Fernando Valley and other parts of L.A. in search of several documented members of the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang, who they believe are responsible for a recent spate of violence in North Hollywood. Three people were arrested and several more remained outstanding after the raids, but authorities said there was no immediate threat to the community. The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that the search warrant operation was the agency's attempt to not only find out more about the death of a 34-year-old homeless man, who investigators believe might have been killed by MS-13 members in January, but also to send a clear message to the criminal street gang that its ""presence will not be tolerated in the San Fernando Valley or anywhere within the city of Los Angeles."" ""Over the past year, tagging and other evidence of MS-13's presence has been observed at multiple locations throughout the Valley,"" the LAPD said in the statement. ""Officials believe the gang is attempting to establish a foothold by directly challenging rival gangs in the area."" Bradley Hanaway was accosted and shot as he slept at the Valley Plaza Recreation Center in North Hollywood. Investigators believe that MS-13 members killed Hanaway as part of their attempt to claim the territory in and around the recreation center. Authorities have gathered information that suggests MS-13 members are responsible for at least five other violent assaults that occurred in the area of the recreation center shortly after Hanaway was killed, police said. LAPD Det. Dave Peteque told The Times in January that Hanaway was in a park claimed by gang members. ""They shot him for no reason,"" Peteque said of the killers, adding that those who went inside the park were subject to violence and harassment. Alex Alonso, a gang expert and professor at Cal State Long Beach, said MS-13 has a significant presence in L.A. That includes an area in North Hollywood near Fulton Avenue, where MS-13 has been active for a few decades. But Alonso challenged some LAPD contentions. He said that police officers are often too quick to identify the perpetrators of a crime as gang members, and that when officers do make those claims, it is sometimes based on little evidence. Also, he said, one of the biggest myths about gangs is the nature of territoriality. ""Cops will come to court and testify that this one gang is wanting to expand   'They want to expand for drug purposes'   but a gang's territory is defined by the residential patterns of its members,"" said Alonso, who has researched gangs for 26 years. ""I always challenge the cops [in court]   'Give me an example of when Gang A went into the Gang B's turf and took it over'   and there's no examples of that happening in Los Angeles. It's a big myth. The gang is based on where the members live."" During Wednesday's operation, investigators seized several weapons, ammunition, electronic media and gang paraphernalia from about 10 locations. LAPD officers worked with the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services on the raids because the agency believed there might be children at the targeted homes who could possibly be subjected to neglect or abuse, the agency said in its statement. Twenty children were assessed, and as a result, three investigations involving nine children were initiated, according to the LAPD. No children were immediately removed from the homes. The LAPD worked with DCFS and the Los Angeles County Probation Department to close the investigation, which officials spent about five months building.

"'if you're directly complicit in spreading hate, consider dining at home': restaurant owner who kicked sarah sanders out last year defends chicago server who spat on eric trump in a cocktail bar","The Virginia restaurant owner who kicked Sarah Huckabee Sanders out of her restaurant last year is defending the Chicago cocktail bar server who spat in Eric Trump's face last week, saying politicians involved in 'spreading hate' should consider dining at home. Stephanie Wilkinson made headlines last year when she booted Sanders out of her restaurant the Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia. Now she's backing the unnamed server at the upscale Chicago bar The Aviary who spat in Eric Trump's face as he walked in on Tuesday night and was briefly detained by Secret Service agents. Wilkinson says restaurants are 'a part of the soundstage for our ongoing national spectacle'. 'Whether the bar or restaurant serves merely as the backdrop... or takes an active role in the drama, as was the case with Cracker Barrel, Aviary or my restaurant last June, the business involved inevitably comes under attack,' Wilkinson wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Post published Friday. 'A portion of the public will scold owners and managers about ""staying in their lane"" and express chagrin at the loss of a perceived ""politics-free zone,""' she added. Despite an open service policy where it's illegal to deny someone service because of their race, religion or national origin, Wilkinson says eateries have the right to refuse service. 'If you're an unsavory individual - of whatever persuasion or affiliation - we have no legal or moral obligation to do business with you,' she said. She added that the high-profile clashes usually have nothing to do about the meals themselves. 'It's more often a frustrated person (some of whom are restaurant employees) lashing out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs,' she said. 'Not surprising, if you think about it: You can't call people your enemies by day and expect hospitality from them in the evening,' she added. Wilkinson closed her op-ed saying that when the world returns to 'its normal axis' there will be less 'highly charged encounters' making headlines. But for now her message is clear. 'In the meantime, the new rules apply. If you're directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home,' she said. 'For the rest, your table is waiting,' she added. Wilkinson's bold move to ask Sarah Sanders to leave the Red Hen in June 2018 when she arrived with seven family members was met with public outrage and support. Following the incident Sanders tweeted about the encounter saying she 'politely left' and '[Wilkinson's] actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.' Wilkinson said that her employees felt uncomfortable having Sanders there and took a vote before asking her to leave. On Tuesday June 25 Eric Trump was visiting Chicago for work when he walked into the upscale Aviary bar - run by the famed chef Grant Achatz. After entering a female server approached him and allegedly spat on him. U.S. Secret Service took that employee into custody and Chicago Police arrested her. Eric then asked Chicago Police to let her free when told she would otherwise be charged. Alinea Group, which runs the bar, says that the employee has been placed on leave.",politics,Boston Herald,right
"singing doctor retires after serenading more than 8,000 babies","Over his 40-year career, Dr. Carey Andrew-Jaja has delivered 8,000 babies and received the special nickname of ""The Singing Doctor."" That's because he sang to every single one of the babies he delivered   and then some. Dr. Andrew-Jaja, who worked at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh, loves to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and Louis Armstrong's hit, ""What A Wonderful World,"" to the newborns. He explained his song choice in a video for UPMC. ""To me, it's a wonderful thing in my hand, the miracle of life,"" he said. ""And the rest of is that it's a beautiful world we live in. We forget about all the crisis going on everywhere for a moment when you see that miracle of life in front of you."" The OB/GYN said he took up singing to the babies when he was just starting his career. ""I like to sing. But this particular part of singing to babies started when I was a resident,"" Dr. Andrew-Jaja said in the video. ""There was a gentleman, an older obstetrician-gynecologist on staff and he loved to sing. And later on when he was about to retire, he asked me, 'Andy, do you sing to your babies?' And I said, 'Well, no. It's your stuff,'"" Dr. Andrew-Jaja said. ""And he said, 'Go ahead, do it.' So, I took it over. He passed on the baton to me,"" he continued. ""And I took it over and I started to sing to my babies ever since then and I do it every time."" Now, four decades later, Dr. Andrew-Jaja has sung his last lullaby at the hospital. At the end of June he officially retired, UPMC told CBS News. He actually stopped delivering babies a few years ago, but kept seeing OB patients, UPMC said. It isn't uncommon for doctors to do this and although he wasn't at their deliveries, Dr. Andrew-Jaja would visit patients in the postpartum wing after their babies were born   and he would still sing. He'd check on the moms and babies and give them the gift of song. Lindsay Grimes was one of the last moms to receive that gift. ""We're so excited to have a new addition to our family,"" Grimes told UPMC ahead of Dr. Andrew-Jaja's visit. ""So, to have him sing to one of our babies would be awesome."" The doctor visited Grimes and her newborn, Luella, and sung his signature: ""What a Wonderful World."" Dr. Andrew-Jaya said that the last baby he sang to was just as important as his first. ""Each of them is an individual. You know, I've delivered thousands and thousands of babies,"" he said in the UPMC video. ""When I'm singing to those babies, I think I'm singing to a future important person. That's the credit I give to all of them."" While he's officially retired from both delivering babies and visiting patients, Dr. Andrew-Jaja's legacy as ""The Singing Doctor"" will continue in Pittsburgh. Councilman Corey O'Connor declared May 16 ""Dr. Carey Andrew-Jaja Day"" this year.",politics,Boston Herald,right
family of man fatally shot by police in eagan seeks answers,"The family of Isak Abdirahman Aden on Monday asked state investigators to release more information about an officer-involved shooting last week in Eagan that left him dead. Aden, 23, of Columbia Heights, died of multiple gunshot wounds during a July 2 standoff with police outside a business. Aden was a domestic assault suspect armed with a gun, Eagan police said. ""He didn't deserve to die the way that he did,"" his sister, Sumaya Aden, 21, said at a news conference held at the South Minneapolis offices of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""I refuse to be silent and will never rest until his justice is served."" CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said there are ""so many questions"" related to the incident that are not being answered by law enforcement. He called upon the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is leading the investigation, to release ""all information"" regarding the shooting, including police reports, 911 audio tapes and video footage from squad cars and body-worn cameras. ""We're seeking that information today so that we can come to a conclusion based on the full facts that are still missing from this case,"" Hussein said. Last week, Eagan Police Chief Roger New said little about the alleged domestic assault that led to police being called to the area. He said officers negotiated with Aden for more than four hours before several officers fired shots at him. New said it was too early to say what prompted the officers to shoot and which agencies they are with. Numerous suburban metro police agencies had responded. A gun that Aden had was found at the scene, New said. Aden's brother, Badrudin Aden, 20, said Monday he was at the scene of the standoff ""when my brother was executed by law enforcement officers."" Hussein said the family would not comment about the domestic assault allegation or the shooting. ""At this point, right now, because there's so much information that is being withheld from the family, we're holding off about speaking directly about the incident,"" Hussein said. BCA INVESTIGATION CONTINUES In a statement Monday, the BCA said its investigators continue to conduct initial interviews with incident participants and witnesses. The BCA said it would not discuss an active investigation or release investigative data, including video evidence, while the case is open. ""Most investigative data, including video evidence, will be made public once the case is closed,"" the statement read. The BCA said it has met with and will continue to meet with Aden's family and they ""will be provided the opportunity to view the video evidence prior to its release."" The agency said names of the officers who fired their guns will be released once ""all who took part in or witnessed the incident have made themselves available to be interviewed by BCA agents."" 'HE HAD GOALS AND DREAMS' Aden was taking IT classes at the University of Minnesota and had a full-time job at a bank, his family said. ""I can wholeheartedly say that my brother truly embodied what it meant to be a kind and good person,"" his sister said.

atlanta mayor endorses joe biden for president,"ATLANTA -- Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for president. Bottoms was a guest of Biden's during Thursday night's Democrat debate, a debate in which some observers are calling a poor showing from the former vice president. Bottoms informed the Associated Press of her endorsement prior to her formal announcement, set for later Friday. Biden appeared with several other Democrats during Thursday night's debate, along with U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. Harris, who is black, challenged Biden to explain his decades-old position with respect to school desegregation, one which she characterized as being against busing. ""I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed was busing ordered by the Department of Education,"" Biden countered. Harris, the former prosecutor turned California senator, said she didn't think the former vice president ""was a racist."" But she criticized him for recently ""defending segregationists"" in the Senate and for once opposing mandatory busing of students to desegregated public schools. Harris described a young girl in the 1970s who boarded such buses before dramatically offering, ""That little girl was me."" The moment was as powerful as it was unexpected, a searing line of attack against Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president. Biden entered back-to-back nights of Democratic presidential debates in Miami as the leading Democratic candidate. In deeply personal tones, Harris hammered Biden for policy choices that she suggested betrayed the spirit of the civil rights movement, if not directly opposing all it stood for. Then she really hit her stride, exhibiting the controlled force of a practiced cross-examiner. ""Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America?"" Harris asked. A visibly angry Biden responded that his record was mischaracterized. But he was left denying Harris' comments on a technicality, saying he didn't oppose public school busing, just it being ordered by the Department of Education   decrying federal intervention on the issue on behalf of states. Harris shot back, ""There are moments in history where states fail to support the civil rights of people."" Biden offered only curt responses after that and was so flustered that he failed to lean on his time as Barack Obama's vice president   seeming unsure of himself for prolonged stretches on national television. Senior advisers to Biden insisted afterward that they weren't surprised by the confrontation with Harris and were satisfied with his response in the time allowed. They noted that while he dismissed Harris' characterization of his relationship with segregationist senators in his early years in the Senate more than 45 years ago, Biden appeared to be listening while she criticized his position on busing. A total of 20 presidential candidates took the stage over the course of the two nights   10 candidates on Wednesday and another 10 on Thursday. All 10 of the candidates on Thursday's stage raised their hands when NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked if they would support providing health care for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. While touting the diversity of their party, some of the younger candidates suggested it may be time for the older generation of leaders to pass the torch, a clear dig aimed at the 76-year-old Biden.

fort worth police hope to alleviate lgbtq community's fears after 2 trans women killed,"After two transgender women were killed in Dallas in the past month, a meeting Monday night between the Fort Worth Police Department and LGBTQ groups in Fort Worth was both timely and needed, attendees and community leaders said. Muhlaysia Booker , a black transgender woman, was killed in Dallas on May 18. After a second black transgender woman, Chynal Lindsey, was found dead in a lake, some Fort Worth members of the LGBTQ community were afraid they were the next target. About 60 people went to a transgender group's meeting last week, and many of them were scared, said Finnigan Jones, executive director of Trans-Cendence International , at Monday night's meeting. ""That entire day, I had taken calls from community members, particularly some of our senior citizen transgender women, who were afraid to walk their dog. They were afraid to just go to the grocery store and get toilet paper,"" he said. ""And that is the fear that is happening in the community."" About three weeks ago, Fort Worth's interim police chief, Ed Kraus, asked Felipe Gutierrez to help him reach out to the LGBTQ community in Fort Worth in response to the killings in Dallas. Gutierrez, Director Development and Engagement for One Safe Place , helped coordinate Monday's meeting, where about 40 officers, community members and local groups talked about fears in the community, how Fort Worth police can help and how people can defend themselves. Jones asked Kraus and the police department to help set up self-defense training for the LGBTQ community in Fort Worth, particularly for transgender women. He also said some women want help learning how to conceal and carry guns. ""They are just scared because they are transgender women. They feel that transgender women are being targeted,"" he said. Naomi Green, a black transgender woman, said she has felt that fear herself and called the murder of trans women in the U.S. ""a state of crisis."" As the intervention specialist at the nonprofit Abounding Prosperity , Green said Fort Worth has the opportunity to show the U.S. the benefits of the LGBTQ community and police working together. ""We are being killed at alarmingly high numbers,"" she said about transgender women. ""Right now in Dallas and Fort Worth, we have the opportunity to be the face of change."" In 2018, at least 28 transgender people were killed in the U.S., according to data gathered by CNN . All but one of the victims were transgender women, and all but one were people of color. The meeting also comes a week after the 10-year anniversary of the Rainbow Lounge raid , in which a ""bar check"" by Fort Worth police and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission agents resulted in injuries to two patrons, several arrests and citywide protests. Fort Worth officers and LGBTQ leaders at the meeting said they have seen a shift in LGBTQ acceptance in Fort Worth since the raid. In 2000, Fort Worth was the first city in Texas to protect people from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. In 2009, the law was updated to include the same protection for transgender people. Kraus said sensitivity training in the department and more interaction with the gay community has spurred positive change. Finnigan said he tells group members who are fearful of law enforcement that Fort Worth police are on their side. Fort Worth police are far ahead of Dallas law enforcement when it comes to LGBTQ protections, another panelist, Rafael McDonnell with Dallas' Resource Center, said at the meeting. ""Fort Worth is doing right; Dallas needs to catch up,"" he said. Still, leaders said they are working to provide more protections for the LGBTQ community in DFW. ""It was encouraging to hear some of the positive things that were said about the Fort Worth Police Department,"" Kraus said at the end of the meeting. ""I wasn't sure exactly what the feeling was, and it encourages me. But I know we have some improvements we can make, and that's what we'll strive to do.""     ©2019 the Fort Worth Star-Telegram Visit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",crime,Deseret News,right
feds: cincinnati police captain michael savard facing bribery charge,"This story has been updated and clarified. A Cincinnati police captain, already under investigation by the IRS related to financial benefits he allegedly received, faces a federal bribery charge after officials say he asked a sergeant to pay $5,000 for a promotion. At a news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman said Capt. Mike Savard ""tried to shake down"" the sergeant for cash. Savard, 52, was arrested Thursday. The 25-year veteran officer had his police powers suspended in January. City officials have never said why. Savard's attorney, Christopher McDowell, said it has been a ""long-standing practice in the Cincinnati Police Department…to do what it is that my client has been charged with."" He added that multiple police officers have told him the practice is common. ""My client intends to fight these charges,"" McDowell said. ""He is being harassed."" Police Chief Eliot Isaac said during the news conference that early in his career he heard ""chatter about this type of thing occurring."" But now, because of the current retirement system, it would not be lucrative, and it is ""extremely rare"" for it to occur. Isaac said an administrative hearing next week will determine Savard's status with the department. Documents show the department's Internal Investigations Unit, in 2015, investigated Savard regarding off-duty details, leading to official reprimands. Savard worked and oversaw police details at Celebrities nightclub in Roselawn between 2014 and 2015. According to an internal investigation report, he would often receive the entire payments in cash and then disburse that cash himself to the other officers. That charge was sustained as a violation of department policy and he was formally reprimanded in June 2016. In September 2015, Savard and another officer worked on a detail at Ladder 19 Bar and Grill in Corryville. An internal investigation sustained accusations that Savard knew a promotor working with Ladder 19 did not follow protocol when arranging the detail, but Savard completed the assignment anyway. Savard was later reprimanded. Neither reprimand appears in Savard's performance evaluations, an Enquirer review of the captain's personnel file shows. The evaluations said Savard routinely met or exceeded standards. Savard also was under investigation for distributing cash tips to officers assigned to a detail at Celebrities in 2014. Those charges were deemed unfounded by an internal investigation. According to a federal complaint unsealed Friday, Savard asked for and received $5,000 from the sergeant in exchange for Savard's promise to retire early from the department, so the sergeant could be promoted. On May 20, Savard met with the unnamed sergeant, who was next in line to receive a promotion to lieutenant, the complaint says. Savard told the sergeant that he ""was going to work out a deal to plead guilty"" to federal charges related to the ongoing investigation, the complaint says, and that he was considering retiring in July. The complaint says Savard told the sergeant he would be willing to retire earlier, in June, if the sergeant paid him $5,000. The two met again on May 30, the complaint says, and the meeting was recorded by audio. When the sergeant expressed hesitation, the complaint says Savard told him he ""may never have another chance"" to get promoted. Savard said, according to the complaint: ""If we work this out,"" he would leave June 21. When the sergeant offered to pay with a money order, Savard ""stated he wanted cash,"" the complaint says. Savard was paid the $5,000 Thursday, and immediately arrested, documents say. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison on the bribery charge. The case is in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. Savard was promoted to captain in April 2017, according to personnel records obtained by The Enquirer. He was in charge of the Special Services Section. He has received several commendations through the years, including for his work in an off-duty security detail at a birthday party for the late financier Carl H. Lindner Jr. in 1999. He graduated from a high school in Maine and served in the Marines for four years as a communication center operator in Arizona. He earns $113,000 annually with Cincinnati police, according to records.

metro council passes controversial budget in 24-1 vote,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WHAS11)   Officials with Metro Council have overwhelmingly passed the operating budget by a 24 to 1 vote. The city needs to trim around $25 million to make up for its pension obligations. Councilwoman Madonna Flood was the sole no vote. She says that she could not in conscience vote for it and that it would hurt the most vulnerable people. Councilman Anthony Piagentini released a statement on Twitter saying, ""This budget was done in the right way. The Mayor proposed a budget and Metro Council, the voice of the people, changed it to reflect the will of the people. Overwhelming bipartisan consensus."" Metro Councilmembers also voted 25-0 for its capital budget. That budget helps to improve infrastructure. Mayor Greg Fischer's full statement: ""Metro Council has approved a budget that reflects the difficult realities caused by our increasing state pension obligation. This increasing obligation is not the fault of Metro Council nor my office; however, when faced with the choice to raise revenue to prevent reductions in services to our citizens, Metro Council voted against new revenue. ""This budget is not what a thriving city like ours deserves, and it is not the budget that any of us want. ""Because we already have a lean government, there were no easy decisions. I proposed a balanced budget that prioritized public safety and basic city services, while working to minimize the pain on our most vulnerable citizens. ""Though the Council approved 99.5% of the budget I proposed, and I do appreciate that, I would not be doing my job if I did not share with you my concerns about their changes, including that their choices may deepen inequities in our community. ""While I understand and share the desire to keep our library hours the same   and I love our libraries   Council does that by closing Youth Detention Services, before we can work out a solution with the State to keep our most vulnerable youth near their families and their schools. ""The desire to keep the Middletown library is understandable, but Council has done that with deep cuts to our violence prevention efforts. ""And Council has increased their neighborhood spending accounts by cutting the offices that work to create economic development throughout our city, and the office that makes Metro Government more efficient. ""While I disagree with these choices, my team will move forward, balance the budget and find ways to implement them with the least amount of pain to our residents. My thanks go to Budget Chair Bill Hollander for his leadership throughout this process. ""With our pension costs continuing to increase over the coming years, more cuts will keep coming. I don't like it, but that's reality. I understand that many people do not want to raise taxes, but no one likes service cuts either. We must face the reality that we must have new revenue if we want to continue to pursue greatness for our city. ""I pledge to continue to work with the State and our Metro Council to find new revenue, and to keep fighting to make sure Louisville has the services it needs to be the thriving, compassionate city that we all deserve.""

"dems' dream candidate is trump-defeating white man, poll shows","LOS ANGELES, CA   Diversity is taking a back seat to the Democrats' desire to dump Trump, according to a poll published Wednesday. The 2020 presidential candidate field is well stocked with women, people of color and millennials, but a majority of voters who said they expected to cast ballots in a Democratic primary thought that candidates who were white, middle-aged and male would be the party's best bet for defeating President Trump, the Los Angeles Times reported. That finding from the latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times national poll (a poll that proved more accurate than most in 2016) illustrates the hurdles that female, black and Latino presidential candidates still face despite Democrats' celebration of diversity in their ranks. The poll also illustrates the wariness, bordering on pessimism, that many Democratic voters continue to show in the aftermath of Trump's upset victory in 2016. Asked to describe the ideal candidate to beat Trump, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters said a white candidate had the best chance of winning in 2020; 7 in 10 said a man would have the best shot; and about three-quarters said the strongest candidate against Trump would be age 41-65. A small majority favored a moderate over a more liberal or progressive candidate. Combined, 56% said they thought their best bet would be a white male candidate, with just over one-third opting for a white male moderate. Such calculations about electability have become a prominent and controversial part of the 2020 campaign. The belief on the part of many voters that a white male candidate has the best shot against Trump has buoyed the candidacy of Vice President Joe Biden, who has led in polls this spring. Other candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, have criticized the focus on who is most electable. ""I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't be elected,"" Warren said at a recent MSNBC town hall. ""I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't be elected. And here we are."" Warren, like other candidates lagging behind Biden in polls, has been urging voters to focus on candidates' leadership qualities and policies, rather than trying to gauge their electability because guessing who can win an election a year away is all but impossible. Although voters preferred a middle-age nominee in the abstract, when they were asked about specific candidates, majorities chose the two oldest candidates -- Biden, 76, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 77 -- as the ones mostly likely to beat Trump. More than 8 in 10 said Biden would definitely (39%) or probably (47%) win in November; 60% said that about Sanders, although only 17% said they thought he would definitely win. Democratic voters were less optimistic about six other candidates the survey asked about. A majority said Trump probably or definitely would beat Warren, Harris or Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind. Even as Warren has been gaining ground in recent polls, the USC poll found that 55% of Democratic primary voters said Trump would probably (42%) or definitely (13%) beat her. Harris and O'Rourke were given roughly the same odds. Booker, Buttigieg and Klobuchar were judged less likely to win. City News Service",politics,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,right
"at burn camp near kerrville, child survivors can be themselves","KERRVILLE   When she was 3, Karla Ovalle and her twin sister were playing in their back yard with their uncle, who was preparing a barbecue. While her uncle was inside the house getting her sister some water, Karla started playing with a gasoline container and accidentally threw it onto the pit. The flames rose and engulfed her, and ""I don't remember much after that,"" said Karla, now 16. ""I know my neighbors helped me."" She spent six months in the hospital recovering from burns covering the front of her body. While there, Karla's mother learned about the Camp David Burn Camp. Karla is now in her eighth year spending a free summer week at the Texas Lions Camp facility in rural Kerr County. On Wednesday, she and 52 other campers enjoyed an hour with firefighters from all over Central Texas who talked about their job, showed the kids the equipment they use and let them drench each other, as well as their counselors, with a fire hose. Kerrville Fire Department Lt. Zane Zenner said being able to do it brings him a ""whole piece of gratitude."" ""Seeing an individual who's gone through so much hardship and to see them happy ... it brings a whole lot of joy to not just me but to everyone,"" Zenner said. Hosted by the Texas Burn Survivor Society, Camp David gives child burn survivors, their siblings and children of burn survivors the opportunity to engage with other kids ages 7 to 16 who understand what they've experienced. It helps the children realize they are not alone, relieving the isolation they might feel in their day-to-day lives, the society's executive director, Sue Dodson, said. ""Everyone has injuries, everyone knows someone who has injuries,"" volunteer Daryl Burns, 37, said of the campers. ""When you get to come here, the only thing expected of you is that you be a good person and have fun."" Camp David provides a lot of activities   rock climbing, zip lines, fishing, arts and crafts, archery, horse riding and ""firefighter day,"" which this year drew first responders from San Antonio, Austin, Kerrville and Waco. San Antonio Fire Department Chief Charles Hood said he brings his sons with him to the camp ""so they can see that adversity happens to everyone and they can overcome it."" Sheridan Hood, 16, who has been there eight times, was impressed at the campers' attitudes. ""I feel like, I see these kids and their burns and they're always just smiling,"" he said. ""They always seem like they're having a good time."" After hearing her older sisters say good things about the camp, Karla was excited to attend with her twin sister when they turned 7. Chaciti McMorris, 15, who was burned on her left side from boiling water that fell on her as she and her brother were playing in their kitchen, recalled the anxiety she felt her first year at camp. ""I was really nervous, but my brother came with me the first year. I was nervous I wouldn't have everything,"" Chaciti said. A camp volunteer for seven years, Burns said the new kids arriving Sunday to start their stay sometimes struggle to open themselves up to others. ""Generally, we'll see that they don't want to leave mom and dad,"" he said. ""We usually see the opposite reaction on Saturday."" Chaciti found the camp very welcoming. ""The first day is always the most awkward, but once you camp out everything is a lot less awkward because you spend a lot of time talking and getting to know each other,"" she said. The camp wouldn't be able to serve burn survivors without the help of its volunteers. ""The first year I was here, I thought it was for them,"" Burns said. ""Then I got hooked and it's still my favorite week of the year."" He said volunteering at the camp has given him a perspective that has has helped him get through his own challenges. ""It doesn't matter what's going on in your life. You come out here and see these kids, you realize how trivial it is,"" Burns said.

unesco lists iraq's babylon as world heritage site,"UNESCO's World Heritage Committee voted on Friday to list the sprawling Mesopotamian metropolis of Babylon as a World Heritage Site after three decades of lobbying efforts by Iraq. Iraq had been trying since 1983 to have the site -- a massive 10-square-kilometre complex of which just 18 percent has been excavated thus far -- recognised by UNESCO. Straddling Iraq's Euphrates River about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of Baghdad, the city was the centre of the ancient Babylonian empire more than 4,000 years ago. ""What is the world heritage list without Babylon? How to tell the history of humanity without the earliest of old chapters, Babylon?"" said Iraq's representative to UNESCO's World Heritage Committee ahead of the vote. The committee met in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to consider Babylon and another 34 sites, including in Brazil and Burkina Faso, for the List. ""It fills a gap that was evident on the list and indeed, this is a type of site that we can say this convention was actually designed to protect,"" said Tunisia's delegate. After the successful vote, Iraq's delegation clasped hands and invited all delegates ""to visit Babylon, the cradle of civilisation."" Babylon developed as a walled city of mudbrick temples and towers, known internationally for its hanging gardens, the Tower of Babel, and the Ishtar Gate. Excavation began there in the early 1800s and artefacts were sent abroad, including parts of the Ishtar Gate which remain in museums across Europe. - 'Extremely vulnerable condition' - The site was substantially impacted by new structures built under dictator Saddam Hussein and further damaged by soldiers during the US-led invasion that toppled him in 2003. UNESCO on Friday said the site's ""extremely vulnerable condition"" sparked ""serious concerns, with many structures in urgent need of conservation and several on the verge of collapse."" But it opted not to designate Babylon as a World Heritage Site in Danger after objections from Iraq, and instead said it would work with local authorities to set a plan of action for conservation. ""Babylon is the largest populated city in ancient history,"" said Qahtan al-Abeed, who heads the Basra Antiquities Department and led efforts to get the site listed. ""The Babylonians were the civilisation of writing, administration and science,"" he told AFP. The UNESCO designation ""will encourage research and development of the site,"" and would ""be free publicity for tourists,"" he added excitedly. Babylon is one of 7,000 archeological sites across Iraq, many of which were destroyed by the Islamic State group or ravaged by lucrative artefact smuggling. Five have been listed by UNESCO, including the Arbil citadel in northern Iraq and the southern Mesopotamian marshes. The three others are also on the agency's ""World Heritage in Danger"" list and include Hatra, an ancient city in northern Nineweh province damaged by IS in 2014. Samarra, along the Tigris River, was added in 2007 and Ashur, the capital of the Assyrian empire, in 2003. Iraq has another 11 ""tentative"" sites hoping to be listed by UNESCO. After decades of back-to-back conflict, the country declared victory against IS in 2017 and is now basking in a period of relative calm. It has sought to attract both international investors and tourists, and hopes its prominence on UNESCO's lists can do both.",politics,National Review,right
"cuomo's mta board appointment may violate a state law, says ex-assemblyman who wrote it","Gov. Cuomo's move to put his state budget director on the MTA board may violate a state law, according to the former assemblyman who wrote it. The Public Authorities Reform Act of 2009 (PARA) requires that board members of public agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ""have an explicit fiduciary duty to the authority and not to the appointing entity."" Former Assemblyman Richard Brodsky (D-Westchester) was the chief sponsor and author of that law. Asked about Cuomo's nomination of state budget director Robert Mujica to the MTA board, Brodsky said, ""The law makes it clear that board members have one loyalty   not to the person who appointed them, not to the person who employs them, but to the mission of the entity."" ""The question is can you have a fiduciary obligation to people with competing interests, and the answer to that is probably no,"" he said. ""It (the law) applies to anybody who has a fiduciary obligation to an employer that may be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligation to the MTA."" Brodsky called Mujica a ""smart and able guy,"" adding that ""the job of the mayor and the governor is to appoint good people [to the MTA board] and leave them alone."" ""If you let conflicted members onto the board, then essentially political and policy determinations are being made that are not in the best interest of the authority."" Board members of public authorities like the MTA are required to sign an oath before taking office, which states that they are allowed to listen to comments from elected officials but that their ""ultimate decision"" be consistent with the ""mission of the authority."" Mujjica in January released a statement arguing the Legislature should give Cuomo more authority over the MTA. He said the governor should be able to make more board appointments and have the ability to hire and fire people within the agency. Mujica will already need lawmakers to exempt him from a state law requiring MTA board members to live in the 12 downstate counties served by the agency. Sources said Mujica would need a similar kind of written exemption from PARA to serve as both budget director and MTA board member. Mujica has previously gotten such a pass to serve on other public authority boards like the New York Local Government Assistance Corporation. Cuomo said on Monday that Mujica's appointment would not break the law, citing city Department of Transportation Commissioner and outgoing MTA board member Polly Trottenberg as an example. ""The state budget director serves the state, administers the funding to the MTA,"" said Cuomo. ""I don't see that there's any conflict whatsoever with being the budget director just like I don't see there's any conflict with being the transportation commissioner."" Based on Brodsky's explanation, Trottenberg's seat on the board could be at odds with the law because she has a fiduciary obligation to both New York City and the MTA. ""There was never any conflict concerning Commissioner Trottenberg's appointment, which was consistent with all relevant provisions of state law,"" said Seth Stein, a spokesman for Mayor de Blasio. Trottenberg is due to leave the board on which she served for five years as soon as her replacement is confirmed by the state Senate. Cuomo spokesman Patrick Muncie defended Mujica's appointment to the MTA board, citing 28 other public authority boards on which the budget director also serves. ""There is a history and practice of the state budget director sitting on the boards of entities with a state interest,"" said Muncie. ""The state also has a clear interest in the outcomes at the MTA having authorized $25 billion in new revenue for the MTA.""     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,right
trump signs executive order calling for upfront disclosure of hospital costs,"Video by FOX Business President Trump on Monday signed an executive order demanding the upfront disclosure by hospitals of the actual prices for common tests and procedures. Trump's order also requires that patients be told ahead of time what their out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copays will be for many procedures. ""This landmark initiative continues our work to put American patients first,"" Trump said during remarks at the White House before signing the order. ""We are fundamentally changing the nature of the health care marketplace."" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters before Trump's remarks that the idea is to give patients practical information that they can use to help save money. For example, if a hospital charges your insurer $3,500 for a type of echocardiogram and the same test costs $550 in a doctor's office, you might go for the lower-price procedure to save on copays. The executive order calls for a rule-making process by federal agencies, which typically takes months or even years. The details of what information will have to be disclosed and how it will be made available to patients must be worked out as part of writing the regulations. That will involve a complex give-and-take with hospitals, insurers and others affected. Consumers will have to wait to see whether the results live up to the administration's promises. Lack of information on health care prices is a widespread problem . It's confusing for patients, and experts say it's also one of the major factors that push up U.S. costs. The same test or procedure, in the same city, can cost widely different amounts depending on who is performing it and who is paying the bill. Hospital list prices, which are available, don't reflect what they actually get paid by insurers and government programs. The health insurance industry said disclosing negotiated prices will only encourage hospitals that are now providing deeper discounts to try to raise their rates to match the top-tier facilities. ""Publicly disclosing competitively negotiated proprietary rates will reduce competition and push prices higher   not lower   for consumers, patients, and taxpayers,"" Matt Eyles, head of the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement. While the prices Medicare pays are publicly available, private insurers' negotiated rates generally are not. Industry officials say such contractual information is tantamount to trade secrets and should remain private. Azar pushed back against that argument, saying insurers do ultimately disclose their payment rates when they send individual patients an ""explanation of benefits."" That's the technical term for the form that patients get after they've had a procedure or seen the doctor. The president used his remarks to also take shots at former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as well as 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders and his ""Medicare for all"" plan. Sanders' plan would replace job-based and individual private health insurance with a government-run plan that guarantees coverage for all with no premiums, deductibles and minimal copays for certain services. ""Democrats in Congress support Bernie Sanders' socialist takedown of American health care,"" Trump said. ""Under my administration, we will not let that happen.""

paul muschick: big name democrats shined but one dazzled in thursday's debate,"Now, that was better. Thursday night's Democratic debate had the life that Wednesday's lacked. Candidates challenged each other more and forced each other to answer some difficult questions. The big names   Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and especially Kamala Harris   dominated the conversation. In their first opportunity to go toe-to-toe, they worked hard to make their points and to discredit the points of the others. Some of the other candidates fared well at times, while others were invisible. As expected, poll leader Biden was targeted by opponents. Thirty-eight-year-old Eric Swalwell cleverly took a few shots at Biden's age by using his own words against him. He told the story of when a young Biden said 32 years ago it was time ""to pass the torch"" to a younger generation. Swalwell told Biden it was time for him to do that now. ""I'm still holding on to that torch,"" responded Biden, 76. Harris scolded Biden for opposing busing for all students and for supporting whom she described as racist former colleagues on the Senate, a reference to comments Biden made at a recent fundraiser where he touted his relationship early in his career with senators who were segregationists. Biden denied doing either: ""I did not praise racists,"" he said. He said he opposed only the federal government's order to bus. What was interesting: The performance of Harris. She made her points well on nearly every topic that came up. Her personal stories, including being a young black girl riding the school bus, resonated. The Medicare-for-all divide: The candidates generally agreed that all Americans should be able to have government health insurance. They disagreed about how to get there. Sanders' plan to eliminate private insurance in favor of Medicare-for-all is well known. Others, including Biden, Michael Bennet and Pete Buttigieg said they prefer to build on the Obamacare system and add an option for people to choose government coverage. Immigration: Every candidate said they supported making illegal immigrants eligible for government-provided health insurance. Several said they did not believe people here illegally should be deported solely for that reason. Several also said they would decriminalize it, echoing comments made by some candidates during Wednesday's debate. College debt: While other candidates called for public colleges (Sanders) or community colleges (Biden) to be free for all, Buttigieg brought a voice of reason, questioning why the children of the filthy rich shouldn't have to pay something. Didn't belong: Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson are wasting their time and money staying in the race based on their performance Thursday. Mute the mics: The moderators lost control several times as candidates talked over each other trying to be heard. In future debates, microphones should be kept off and activated only when a candidate is recognized to speak. And they should be cut off when a candidate rambles on after being told their time is up. Limit the field: Two 10-candidate panels was not manageable. Like I said in my column after Wednesday's session , this wasn't a debate. It was speed dating. Candidates barely had time to make a point before their talking time was up. The bar to qualify for future debates in this election, and in future ones, must be set higher.

help for nursing homes runs into federal funding rules,"A bill in the Legislature to help nursing homes and their workers has resulted in a political squabble over money and federal regulations. At stake in the debate is the pay for roughly 10,000 people working in nursing homes -- and, therefore, the budgets for the homes themselves. Two-thirds of all nursing home patients in the state are covered by the Medicaid program. The state determines how much homes are reimbursed for services, including worker salaries. But much of the Medicaid money comes from the federal government, so it has a say in how the funds are spent. RELATED: Nursing homes say state has to provide more money That may help to explain the current dispute. In 2018, nursing homes were given a one-time increase to cover the added salary expenses resulting from minimum wage increases. Last month, the Legislature passed a bill to provide about $1.4 million to continue pay at the current level for another two years, while DHHS conducts a complete study of reimbursement rates. The bill passed unanimously, but Gov. Janet Mills hasn't signed it. Instead, she put the funding plan on hold, because the administration is worried it could exceed the Upper Payment Limit for Medicaid set by the federal government. DHHS Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew says it's a real problem. ""To be clear,"" Lambrew says, ""the issue at hand is whether or not the rate increases violate federal law. We're looking at that, looking at options to see how, within federal constraints, we can support nursing homes."" Republicans in the House and Senate have been complaining. They say the Governor and DHHS are ignoring a provision in the bill that would cut back the added funding if it exceeded the Upper Payment Limit. And they argue the hold on the salary bill will threaten nursing homes, especially if they have to cut pay. ""If I were a nursing home CEO or owner or manager, I would be fretting right now,"" says Sen. Marianne Moore of Calais, a leading voice for the GOP on the issue. ""What am I going to do? I can't reduce the salaries of my employees. I'm going to lose them."" Rick Erb of the Maine Health Care Association, which represents the nursing homes, says it's also a concern for the industry. ""We can't afford to lose any ground now as far as wages go, because it's just too easy to find jobs somewhere else, and that's the concern. Any bad news on wage reimbursement will create problem for our providers."" The Mills Administration and a spokeswoman for Democratic Senate President Troy Jackson, who sponsored the funding bill, both say the new state budget includes $8.5 million in additional funding for nursing homes, separate from the bill the Governor is holding. The Governor's office says much of the $8.5 million will be used for cost of living increases for nursing home workers. ""We are looking at the funding that got appropriated just recently,"" Lambrew says. ""We will implement that as soon as possible."" The Commissioner wouldn't give any guarantees about maintaining current salary levels, but tried to put a positive spin on the uncertainty currently surrounding the situation. ""We believe there is a path forward. We just need to sit down, work it through and make sure it is consistent with federal law, as well as state direction.""",politics,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,right
Boston ICE chief: Democratic 'concentration camp' slur 'disheartening',"A top Boston ICE official is slamming Democratic comparisons of immigrant detention centers to ""concentration camps,"" while also taking aim at any implementation of sanctuary city policies as ""a crime in itself."" ""To be compared to a concentration camp is very disheartening,"" Todd Lyons, deputy director of Boston's Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, said Tuesday on Boston Herald Radio . He dismissed the remarks by hard-left freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) and others as an anti-Trump political backlash that is unfairly targeting ICE. ""We did a lot of good immigration enforcement from 2010 to 2016, so it's extremely frustrating when that same work is compared to being such horrific acts   when in the past we were praised for the enforcement actions we took,"" Lyons said. ""To be painted with a broad brush like that, especially with comments that are so inaccurate, is disheartening."" Ocasio-Cortez made the comparison in a video and then tweeted, ""This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying."" The comments drew fire from Republicans and Jewish groups who said the comparison to the camps where Jews were held and killed en masse by Nazi Germany cheapens the memory of the Holocaust. Lyons said the detention centers where migrants are held while U.S. authorities determine whether they have viable asylum claims or will be deported have higher standards than normal U.S. prisons. Lyons also took aim at sanctuary city policies. ""To tie the hands of ICE or to block us from doing our job and supporting local law enforcement   it's really a crime in itself,"" Lyons said. A number of Massachusetts cities have policies that bar cooperation between local police and federal immigration officials, including Boston. A state judge, meanwhile, is under federal indictment, accused of helping an illegal immigrant defendant evade ICE agents. ""We do have a lot of sanctuary city-style policies. We do have a lot of laws through the state which hamper how law enforcement deal with ICE,"" Lyons said. ""It hampers public safety   it really does."" Supporters of such laws say that if local cops work with ICE, illegal immigrants will less likely call police. Lyons said his office is monitoring nearly 70,000 immigrants in New England. He said his office prioritizes illegal immigrants who have committed other crimes, but added, ""Just because we prioritize doesn't mean that a specific class of removal proceedings are exempt. As we encounter individuals through our daily immigration duties we will take immigration action throughout Massachusetts.""",politics,Boston Herald,right

Omarosa accuses White House of destroying evidence for Mueller investigation,"Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman says she believes the Trump administration destroyed evidence that was supposed to be handed over to special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his Russia investigation. Manigault Newman, who departed the Trump administration in December 2017, said she was instructed to leave documents related to the Trump campaign and transition by then-White House chief of staff John Kelly upon her exit. She claimed the instruction was a ""clear directive"" she and others were given to keep all documents concerning Mueller's investigation. ""I think it's important to realize that very early on in the administration, we got letters directing us to preserve all information related to the Mueller investigation ― all investigations, any information, any emails, any correspondence,"" Manigault Newman said during an interview Saturday with Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC. ""So I thought it was very interesting that after my discussion with ... Kelly in the [White House] Situation Room when I went to take my things, I was instructed that I had to leave seven boxes of documents that came from the campaign, the inauguration, the transition, and they would not allow me to get them,"" Manigault Newman said. Manigault Newman said she doesn't believe the Trump administration provided Mueller's team with the boxes. According to an email exchange with members of the administration, only two of the boxes out of the seven were referenced. She said that ""leads me to believe that they've destroyed the other five."" She said she's ""not the only one"" who had such an experience, and suggested the Trump administration destroyed even more documents. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner. Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March. His team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Attorney General William Barr says he determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue that Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.",legal arguments,Washington Examiner,right
Shakespeare in the Parks turns 15 with all-female 'Julius Caesar',"Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks' 15th-season offering is a sign of the times   an all-female cast and production team in ""The Tragedy of Julius Caesar."" The company that brings free Shakespeare productions to city parks will perform the 90-minute adaptation Sept. 7-29 at sites and times that have not been determined. ""Many of us coming up in theater have experienced a lot of patriarchy and a lot of sexism, and we quite simply want to do it our way, and tell our story,"" said Jennifer Tober, PSIP founder and artistic director. She added that ""the person who is running the country now, making misogynistic remark after misogynistic remark"" is another reason for women in the arts to push back. ""It's our way of saying, 'No, we're not going to be told to be pretty or to be sexy or to be quiet or that we can't do the things that men can do.' And all of us working in this production have experienced that in the theater."" Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks is on trend with other all-female or female/nonbinary productions of the Bard's plays, including Pittsburgh Public Theater's ""The Tempest"" in January. The cast for ""Julius Caesar"" includes Lisa Ann Goldsmith, currently seen in Kinetic Theatre's ""The Speckled Band,"" as Cassius, Shammen McCune as Brutus, Irene Alby as Caesar and Harper York is Mark Antony. Beside taking a stand as part of the #MeToo/#TimesUp movement, the all-female team reflects the company's push for more diversity in both its audience and hiring, Tober said. After 15 years, it's still exciting to see people from foreign countries or other states finding their way to city parks and joining Pittsburghers in celebrating the Bard's work, she said. ""Free art and free exposure to classical art is necessary. Doing theater is great, but doing Shakespeare is better and doing Shakespeare outside for free is the best.""

Rondon family of Lawrence settles with Columbia Gas over teen's death,"The family of Leonel Rondon, the 18-year-old from Lawrence who was killed in last September's gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley, has settled its claims against Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, the parties announced Tuesday. The settlement was ""the result of voluntary mediation between the parties,"" according to a press release. The amount of the settlement is confidential. Rondon was the sole fatality of the Sept. 13 gas disaster, which injured two dozen others and damaged or destroyed more than 100 homes. He died when a chimney dislodged from a house on Chickering Road in Lawrence and landed on the car Rondon, who had just gotten his driver's license, was sitting in. The Rondon family attorney Doug Sheff said, ""Leonel tragically lost his life when a chimney from a nearby house fell onto a car. He was only 18 years old and full of life. He loved science and had a passion for music. He dreamt of going to college and cared for his family members in every way possible. His mother, Rosaly, described Leonel as 'the happiness of the house.' ""The family can only hope that this kind of catastrophe will never happen again. Nothing can replace the loss of Leonel and the Rondons will continue to cherish his memory, his loving support and positive impact on his family and community,"" Sheff continued. Sheff Law will establish a scholarship fund to encourage an ongoing interest in public safety and community service. Columbia Gas will also set up a scholarship fund in Rondon's name, independent of the settlement, the company said. Joe Hamrock, president CEO of NiSource Inc., parent company of Columbia Gas, said, ""We remain heartbroken over the tragic loss of Leonel Rondon and again express our deepest sympathy to his family and to the entire community."" ""We recognize the pain that remains and understand that nothing we can ever say or do will bring Leonel back to his loved ones or erase that pain. Since this tragic event, we have always wanted to do the right thing for the Rondon family and all of those affected, and we are pleased to have reached this settlement,"" Hamrock said. Columbia Gas previously settled with the Figueroa family of Lawrence, several members of whom were injured in the gas-fueled blasts. It was the chimney of the Figueroa's home that landed on the car Rondon was in. Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday, ""I'm glad that it's been settled. I'm sure for the families there's a little bit of satisfaction in that. But fundamentally I don't know how you ever get over the loss of a child, and my heart goes out to both families and to everybody who was affected by this   but it especially goes out to that family because they lost their son.""

Study: An increasing number of Pa. kids living in high-poverty areas,"The share of children in Pennsylvania living in high-poverty neighborhoods has been steadily growing, according to new data released Monday by The Annie E. Casey Foundation as part of its annual ""Kids Count"" state-by-state review. Overall, the report ranked the state 17th in child well-being by various measures of poverty, health, education and family and community metrics. According to its score, Pennsylvania ranks: 'óè 9th in education, evaluating for early education, reading and math scores, and on-time graduation; 'óè 12th in health, by how many kids lack health insurance, child death rates, and other health measures. In Pennsylvania, 4% of kids are uninsured, a rate that has declined since 2010, which advocates attribute to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act; 'óè 20th in economic well-being, using data related to poverty, employment, teen employment, and housing costs; 'óè 25th in family and community measures, which looks at single-parent families and the number of children living in high-poverty areas, among other metrics. The report says 323,000 kids   12% of Pennsylvania children   live in high poverty areas. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is examining communities in the region that have high concentrations of child poverty and how it hurts kids, families and communities, including Rankin , North Braddock , Wilmerding , and Duquesne in Allegheny County, and Saltlick Township in Fayette County. According to the Foundation, since the first data book was released in 1990, the share of children living in high-poverty areas   Census tracts of 30% poverty or greater   worsened by 71% in Pennsylvania. ""Residents of these neighborhoods contend with poorer health, higher rates of crime and violence, poor-performing schools due to inadequate funding and limited access to support networks and job opportunities. They also experience higher levels of financial instability. These barriers make it much harder for families to move up the economic ladder,"" the foundation's report noted. The report, now in its 30th edition, bills itself as ""the most comprehensive annual report on child well-being in the United States."" ""If we want children to be successful, we must provide access to high-quality child care and pre-K programs to build a solid foundation for learning, and adequately invest in public education,"" said Kari King, president and CEO of Pennsylvania Partnerships for Children, the state grantee for the foundation. Ms. King also touted the importance of full participation in the 2020 Census to make sure the state receives its fair share of federal funds for health and human service programs that aid children such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

"Suspect steals 12,000 scratch-off lottery tickets from a convenience store   but they're probably worthless by now","An suspect stole 12,000 in scratch-off lottery tickets from a convenience store in Stafford, Virginia early Saturday morning. The suspect, who also stole 170 cartons of cigarettes, has yet to be identified. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories. A masked suspect broke into a convenience store and stole 12,000 scratch-off lottery tickets, according to the Stafford County Sheriff, along with 170 cartons of cigarettes early Saturday morning. The suspect remains at large. A Stafford County, Virginia sheriff's deputy responded to the Fas-Mart located at 634 Garrisonville Road, after an alarm was triggered on the premises at 4:35 a.m., according to a press release from the department. When the deputy arrived on the scene, she noticed a window had been broken and called for back up.

However, surveillance video did capture the masked suspect in the midst of the theft. The lottery tickets are valued at between $10 to $30 each so amount to a loss between $120,000 to $360,000.

Port Authority to buy insurance for T track after last year's Blue Line flooding,"Port Authority has budgeted money to buy insurance to cover damage for its light rail tracks after it was unable to recover about $2 million in damages from flooding on the Blue Line Library last year. Heavy storms last June caused nearly $5 million in damage last year to the stations at Lytle and Library, a light rail vehicle and about three miles of track. The station and vehicle damages were covered after a $250,000 deductible, but the agency lost about $2 million from track damage when flooding washed away tons of ballast stones along the track and left mud, fallen trees and other debris that took three months to repair. The agency tried to recover that money from federal officials, but they refused to declare the series of storms that caused damage across the state a federal emergency. Mike Cetra, the chief legal officer, said the agency will try to avoid that in the future. The $462.6 million budget the authority's board of directors approved last week includes $265,000 to acquire a special endorsement to the agency's existing commercial insurance to cover track damage when the policy is up for renewal in November. ""We think that's a very conservative number and it might not actually cost that much,"" Mr. Cetra said. In other insurance matters, Mr. Cetra said he remains in discussions with Norfolk Southern over the authority's claim for reimbursement of $3 million in damages after a freight train fell from tracks above Station Square onto the authority's light rail system in August. That crash forced the authority to replace about 1,600 feet of track, 4,000 feet of electrical lines and the support structure that holds them, fiber-optic service for safety signals, a retaining wall and a sidewalk along a bus lane behind the light-rail station at Station Square. It also paid extra to provide alternate service to South Hills riders for about three weeks. And in its third serious incident in the past year, Mr. Cetra said the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority has agreed to pay $88,332 in damages for a January water main break on Grandview Avenue on Mount Washington that damaged the Monongahela Incline. The authority still is assembling the cost for damages from a more serious water main break a month later in the same area that closed the incline for three months and required extensive repairs to a support wall, computer equipment and the station floor.

Immigrant advocates blast Trump over census citizenship question,"Immigrant advocates and sanctuary city leaders are ripping President Trump for pushing forward with the controversial citizenship question on the census, despite the Supreme Court ruling against the query. Attorney General William Barr on Monday said the Trump administration will soon take action that he says will allow the question. Trump, who has been pressing for the government to demand information about citizenship, is expected to issue a memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the inquiry. This is another example of the Trump administration ""pretending that it is above the law,"" the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights in Boston said Tuesday. ""We see no way the White House or Commerce Secretary can possibly provide a legitimate and lawful explanation in support of the citizenship question,"" Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal said in a statement. The Trump administration had argued the question would help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. But a majority of the Supreme Court said last week that reasoning was ""contrived."" The Justice Department had never previously sought a citizenship question in the 54-year history of the landmark voting rights law. Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone said the citizenship question is ""designed to get a census undercount that isn't good for the nation, for Massachusetts, or the Boston region."" The U.S. Census Bureau's experts have said requiring such information would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate count. That in turn would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well. ""Instead of recognizing that he lost, the President is trying to sabotage the Census in a new way: by openly linking the citizenship question to his campaign to terrify and drive out immigrants,"" Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said in a statement. Local Republicans said Tuesday they support the question. ""It seems to be a natural question, whether you are a citizen of this country,"" Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons said. ""To me, that's information we would want to know."" Out of the 23 censuses conducted in the U.S. since 1790, a citizenship question has been asked 10 times   or 43% of the time. According to calculations by the Census Bureau, adding a citizenship question would cause lower response rates among noncitizens, leading to an increased cost to the government of at least $27.5 million for additional phone calls, visits and other follow-up efforts to reach an estimated 630,000 missed households. ""I don't know what the big deal is with putting it back on,"" said Mary Lou Daxland, Northeast regional VP of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies. ""It's just one more reason for Democrats to go against our president."" Herald wire services contributed to this report.",politics,Boston Herald,right
ICE raids could start Saturday: 'This is extremely troubling',"President Trump's reported decision to move ahead with nationwide ICE raids, targeting recent arrivals including migrant families and those with final deportation orders is ""extremely troubling,"" area immigration-rights advocates said Thursday. Trump postponed the operation in late June, but now it appears the sweep could begin this weekend in 10 major cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Miami, according to news reports. Boston is not on the list, but local advocates remain concerned. ""This is extremely troubling,"" said Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. ""It institutionalizes destruction and fear. ""How many millions of taxpayer dollars are being used to terrorize families?"" she added. ""Children will be traumatized by agents storming their homes and taking their parents away."" Trump announced on Twitter last month that the sweep would mark the beginning of a push to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally. Then he abruptly canceled the operation after a phone call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while lawmakers worked to pass a $4.6 billion border aid package that recently was approved. Trump started hinting anew in recent days that more removals were coming. He said last weekend they would be starting ""fairly soon.""

The Michelle Wu train is coming down the tracks!,"City Councilor at Large Michelle Wu has dubbed her big MBTA fare protest Monday the ""Boston T Party"" but the camera-friendly rally looks like it might have another planned destination   a 2021 challenge to Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and an unprecedented progressive, minority takeover of City Hall. ""Michelle Wu is the leader we need,"" wrote Boston resident Jordan Meehan on Twitter Sunday morning, one of many tweets and messages thanking the two-term councilor for organizing the event. The Roslindale Democrat has proven politically nimble during the MBTA firestorm over the past month   leveraging her well-known profile as a T critic to organize widespread frustration about the notoriously problem-plagued subway system. Riders have faced two derailments and ongoing delays in the last month alone. She will continue to flex her organizational muscle Monday as dozens of lawmakers and other local politicians are expected to hit up T stops across Greater Boston to listen to commuter outrage on the very day those riders are hit with a 6% fare increase. ""These fare hikes should never have been approved in the first place,"" Wu told a crowd at Sunday's Park Street protest. Several other local pols vented their frustration. ""Thousands of Cantabrigians will pay more for a public service that has become synonymous w/ delays, derailments & disappointment,"" Cambridge Mayor Marc McGovern wrote on Twitter. ""We will be in Central Square as we protest."" On top of her keen sense of timing, Wu has used her populist message to gather names and numbers of Boston voters, information that helps build a vast campaign network if she decides to launch a 2021 challenge. Perhaps most importantly, Wu has already shown she's willing to take Gov. Charlie Baker to task more than Walsh, who seems to be in a continual bromance fog when it comes to the governor. ""This is about a system that lacks leadership and vision at the top and accountability to those most impacted,"" Wu said. Remember those words, Marty. Next time you hear them, they may well be directed at you. Related Articles Hillary Chabot: No wonder in Encore Boston Harbor casino Hillary Chabot: Trump's mane a media magnet, liberal antagonizer The high-profile event carries plenty of risk for Wu, however. Change at the hulking MBTA happens slowly if at all, and Wu could face an embarrassing political loss if the agency simply shrugs off her complaints … or worse, if her T army fails to show up in force Monday. Meanwhile, the thus-far politically popular Mayor Walsh will be absent from Wu's party today. Undoubtedly entirely by coincidence, she's scheduled her launch while he's thousands of miles away, off at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Hawaii. A main theme of that confab?

"Peduto proposes $500k for blue bins, pushing for ""higher-quality"" recycling","Mayor Bill Peduto wants to dedicate half a million dollars next year to buying blue recycling bins for residents. Mr. Peduto is ""[s]eeking to improve the quality of recycling in Pittsburgh and to boost efforts to meet zero waste goals,"" according to a release sent by his office Wednesday. The need for higher-quality recycling is evidenced by the city's plummeting recycling revenue   a problem not unique to Pittsburgh as global market forces, namely China's stricter importing policies, have sent recycling in the Western world into a tailspin. Single-stream recycling   meaning putting all materials into one bin or bag   used to be profitable for cities. But China, historically the world's biggest importer of recyclables, no longer accepts bales of plastics or paper contaminated with broken glass, greasy pizza boxes, coffee lids and just other general trash. The city is now in the midst of an education campaign to teach residents what should go in a recycling bin , and what should stay out. Glass or plastic bottles with lids removed? Yes. Plastic clamshell strawberry containers? No. The list goes on. Single-use plastic bags that city residents have been trained to put recyclables in are also a contaminant to the system . In fact, workers at the city's recycling sorting facility, Recycle Source in Hazelwood, rip the bags open to sort their contents and keep the bags from wrapping around the sorting machinery. The hope is that residents could place only recyclable materials into a 35-gallon blue bin, bypassing the plastic bag. ""By delivering higher-quality recyclables the bins could generate more revenue for the city and other efficiencies for the Environmental Services bureau, which would offset bin costs,"" Mr. Peduto said in a release Wednesday. The city received $350,000 in state grant money earlier this year to purchase and distribute roughly 13,000 bins over the next two years . In a separate program, the nonprofit Pennsylvania Resources Council distributed 5,200 bins to North Side residents. Council must approve the mayor's $500,000 proposal for the 2020 budget. Mr. Peduto proposes phasing in the bin purchases in the coming years. Residents could be alerted about the availability of bins as early as next year, the release said, though they ""may also buy their own blue bins for usage at any time,"" the release said.

2020 candidate slams DNC for 'arbitrary' rule change that could keep him out of debate,"One 2020 presidential hopeful's chances of securing a spot on the Democratic National Committee's debate stage have been dashed by what his campaign is calling an ""arbitrary"" rule change. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock's campaign manager Jenn Ridder ripped the DNC on Thursday, six days before contenders have to meet the polling and fundraising criteria to participate in the first debate series, for disqualifying a public opinion survey on which Bullock was relying. ""While Governor Bullock was expanding Medicaid to one in ten Montanans despite a nearly 60% Republican legislature, the DNC was making arbitrary rules behind closed doors. The DNC's unmasking of this rule unfairly singles out the only Democratic candidate who won a Trump state   and penalizes him for doing his job,"" Ridder said in a statement. The poll, conducted for Washington Post and ABC News, was excluded because it questioned respondents using an open-ended format. Bullock's campaign said they were only made aware of the development this week, a claim the DNC disputed in a report by Politico . ""An open-ended poll is actually harder to register in, as voters must name their preferred candidate without reading from a list of names,"" the campaign wrote in a memo sent to reporters. A DNC spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to the Washington Examine r's request for comment. Bullock, who waited until the end of Montana's legislative session in May to announce he was running for the White House, was previously considered to be one of seven contenders who'd reached the DNC's polling target set in February of at least 1% support in three polls. He'd yet to satisfy the second criterion of attracting 65,000 donors, with 200 contributors from 20 different states, necessary to participate in Miami.

Threat on social media leads to 'Drag Queen Story Hour' cancellation at library,"A threat posted on social media led the Carnegie Library in Oakland and the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh to cancel ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" programs this week. The threat, posted recently on the social media site Reddit, didn't specifically name the Pittsburgh events but was ""alarming enough"" to cause the cancellation, said library spokeswoman Suzanne Thinnes. Ms. Thinnes said the library occasionally receives emails, calls and protests from people who disagree with the program, but they have always been peaceful. ""This is on a whole different level,"" she said. The ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" program, which has chapters across the nation, involves drag queens reading stories to children in libraries, schools and bookstores. Various branches of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh have hosted the program since 2017. Story hours were scheduled for Friday at the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh and Saturday at the Carnegie Library in Oakland. The same threat caused both cancellations, according to Ms. Thinnes. Ms. Thinnes said the library and Children's Museum consulted the national story time organization before deciding to cancel the programs. She said city and University of Pittsburgh police were notified. Representatives for the Children's Museum and Pittsburgh police could not immediately be reached Saturday. ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" programs in other cities have received threats and protests in recent months. The Carnegie Library always has extra security during the story hours, according to Ms. Thinnes. Saturday's story hour was the last one scheduled by the library system, but Ms. Thinnes said they hope to bring it back. She said families who wanted a program that explored diversity initially brought the event to the library. The story hour was replaced with ""family activities that support individuality and self-expression,"" the library website said. Separately, an online petition organized by an anti-LGBT group urging the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh to cancel Saturday's story hour program had garnered nearly 16,000 signatures. Ms. Thinnes said the library was aware of the petition, but it didn't factor into the cancellation. She said the library treated the petition the same as previous objections it received about the program. ""We have never let bullying or intimidation alter the way we serve the community,"" she said.

'Ma Rainey' filming takes over North Side streets,"Pittsburgh's North Side is ready for its close-up, as outdoor filming of August Wilson's ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is in full swing. West North Avenue exteriors, between Brighton Road and Galveston Avenue, have been repainted, restructured and decorated with props to resemble Chicago, circa 1927, outside the recording studio where Ma Rainey's presence is anticipated by her session musicians. On Tuesday morning, the street was lined with vintage cars awaiting the filming of a scene that in the play is only described, but not seen. When Ma Rainey   Oscar winner Viola Davis in the film   makes her entrance into the recording studio, she is accompanied by her nephew Sylvester (Dusan Brown), her lover Dussie Mae (Taylour Paige) and a policeman, who is threatening to arrest her for an altercation with a cab driver as she tried to flee the scene. At 10:30 a.m., sitting by himself on a stoop as cars from the era were being moved into place, was George C. Wolfe, the director of this Netflix project. Wolfe is a 10-time Tony Award nominee and a winner for ""Take Me Out,"" in 2003. He was watching as actors and crew members were arriving from just-completed filming on Brighton Road, while others had been waiting their turn on North Avenue. Rick Stamerra of White Oak was standing on the steps outside the Flashlight Factory, where extras in 1920s garb were waiting for the principal actors in the car accident scene. He is the owner of Stamerra Plumbing & Heating when he isn't on local stages, chasing his dream of acting.

Urban fishing group gets funding grant,"A Pittsburgh ministry that takes inner-city kids fishing has been awarded a grant by a group whose trustees think that is ""awesome."" Awesome Pittsburgh, a micro-grant organization, presented a grant of $1,000 to the Rev. Spencer Simon for his project Let's Go Fishing at an event in East Liberty Monday. For 17 years, Rev. Simon, of Eastminster Presbyterian Church in East Liberty, has taken kids from urban neighborhoods to an annual fishing derby in Butler County. He was instrumental in encouraging Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy to clean and oxygenate the two-acre Carnegie Lake in Highland Park, and in 2018 he encouraged the state Fish and Boat Commission and the city to stock it with channel catfish, bluegills and largemouth bass. Let's Go Fishing sponsored angling events that drew hundreds to the lake. Every Saturday from June through September, the group provided loaner fishing rods and gear and distributed live bait while staff and volunteers taught fishing skills and provided on-the-water assistance to newcomers. Rev. Simon said it's about more than catching fish. ""I think fishing helps kids to understand that sometimes it takes a while to figure things out, and it gives them the mechanism of how to do it   figuring out where to fish, what bait to use and other elements of fishing,"" he said. ""It helps with mental health issues and social development. It helps them to become better students and have a better life. Fishing gives kids time with their families and a chance to have positive interactions with adults."" Let's Go Fishing accepts donations but has no steady funding source. Rev. Simon said part of the $1,000 grant will be put toward the group's free Inner-City Fishing Skills Event from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. June 29. Saturday fishing assistance and rod loans are expected to be continued this summer. Awesome Pittsburgh is a project of the Awesome Foundation, which describes itself on its website as a trustee-funded group that distributes micro-grants of $1,000, ""on a no-strings-attached basis to people and groups working on awesome projects.""

McConnell to meet with 9/11 first responders following Jon Stewart criticism: report,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will reportedly meet with 9/11 first responders this week, following backlash from advocates including comedian Jon Stewart over the September 11th Victims Fund. John Feal, a first responder who lost part of his foot in a Ground Zero mishap and who later founded the FealGood Foundation, told The New York Post that McConnell agreed to meet with advocates of the fund Tuesday. ""Listen, we come in peace. But we also - we're prepared for anything, whether it's a street fight or Mitch McConnell saying yes,"" Feal told the New York Post. The Hill reached out to a McConnell spokesman for comment. McConnell's office did not respond to the New York Post's request for comment. Stewart called out McConnell, who he said has used the bill as a bargaining chip in the past and has never dealt with the issue compassionately. McConnell dismissed Stewart's accusations , saying, ""I don't know how many times I can say: We've never left the 9/11 victims behind, and we won't again."" Stewart is pushing for a bill that would expand funding for first responders through 2090. Without passing a new bill, funding will likely run out this year. Feal also told the New York Post that President Trump could also push McConnell and other Republicans ""to get on board."" Trump said on Sunday in an interview on NBC's Meet The Press he was ""very impressed"" by Stewart's testimony earlier this month, but did not go so far as to say if he'd direct McConnell to ensure the bill is passed, according to the New York Post . Earlier this month Stewart advocated for the bill alongside first responders at a House subcommittee hearing, sharing an emotional testimony where he condemned representatives for skipping. ""Your indifference costs these men and women their most valuable commodity: time. It's the one thing they're running out of,"" he said at the time. Lou Alvarez, a retired NYPD detective who advocated with Stewart this month, announced he was placed in hospice a day after his trip to the Capitol.",politics,The New York Post,right
"Pelosi feud with AOC, Pressley sows division among Democrats","The ongoing feud between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ""The Squad""   four progressive freshmen representatives including Boston's Ayanna Pressley and New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez   is sowing division at a time when the Democratic Party needs to project a unified   and more centrist   front to retain its majority and knock Donald Trump from office, political observers say. The battle that began over an emergency border aid package in late June has now sparked a war of words between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez   the leader of the so-called ""squad"" that includes Pressley, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.)   with Pressley joining the fray. The barbs have turned personal, despite Pelosi's public message of unity. At her weekly press conference Thursday, Pelosi told reporters, ""We respect the value of every member of our caucus. The diversity of it all is a wonderful thing."" But behind closed doors, Pelosi sounded a different note, reportedly saying, ""You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it. But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK."" Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post earlier this week, ""The persistent singling out … it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful … the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color."" While other minority representatives have jumped to the freshmen lawmakers' defense, political experts tell the Herald that Pelosi is doing what she needs to do to maintain Democratic control of the House. ""What she's doing is singling out four women from very left-wing, safe Democratic districts,"" Elaine Kamarck, of the Brookings Institution, said of Pelosi. ""If there were white guys doing the same thing, she'd be doing the same thing."" Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez are ""wonderful representatives,"" Kamarck said. But ""the reason Nancy Pelosi is speaker and not minority leader is because Democrats won a lot of purple districts   districts that are very much unlike Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district, and unlike Ayanna's district   and if they want to retain leadership … they've got to worry about those districts."" Democratic strategist Patrick Dorton said, ""Attempts by some of the progressive freshman to bully the Democratic Party or their own leadership are counterproductive. If the Democratic Party wants to win in 2020, they need to be on the same team. And right now, that's Pelosi's team."" Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said, ""I think at some point, if they don't start playing ball, they'll find themselves frozen out of real power."" Lina Francis, Pressley's communications director, said in a statement, ""The Congresswoman remains committed to working in partnership with her constituents and her colleagues in congress to develop bold solutions to solve pervasive inequalities felt throughout the country.""",politics,Boston Herald,right
Mackenzie Lueck: Grieving Utah university will hold vigil for slain nursing student from El Segundo,"The University of Utah will hold a memorial Monday evening for Mackenzie Lueck, of El Segundo, whose body was found last week. The kidnapping and killing of Lueck stunned the university and sparked an outpouring of grief and mourning. Salt Lake City police announced Friday that Ayoola Ajayi, 31, had been booked into jail on suspicion of aggravated murder, kidnapping, obstruction of justice and desecration of a body. Lueck, a pre-nursing student studying kinesiology, went missing June 17 after arriving at the Salt Lake City airport following her grandmother's funeral in Los Angeles. After leaving the airport, she took a Lyft to a park in North Salt Lake, where she met with Ajayi, authorities say. It wasn't immediately known when or how Lueck was killed. Police did not provide a possible motive for the slaying. Ajayi's neighbors told authorities that they saw him burning something using gasoline in his backyard on June 17 and 18. When authorities searched his home , they found a freshly dug area along with human tissue belonging to a woman and some of Lueck's personal items that had been charred, authorities said. Friends described her as an energetic and caring person who was always there for them. ""I will remember her as a ball of light. That's what she was. A blond bubble of happiness,"" Michelle Galison, a sorority sister, told KSL-TV. ""I'll never forget seeing her face when she became a part of our little family."" ""She's like a nurturer,"" Kennedy Stoner, a sorority sister, told the Salt Lake Tribune . ""She's almost a mother to me."" The memorial will take place at 6 p.m. on the university's Union Lawn. The Lueck family released a statement expressing appreciation for law enforcement's efforts and asking for privacy. ""The Lueck family would like to express their gratitude for the effort put forth by the Salt Lake City Police Department and partnering agencies who assisted, as well as all of the people that provided tips on this case,"" the statement said. ""They are also grateful to her community, her friends, and people around the nation who have supported this investigation. The family will not be taking any questions and no interviews will be held. Inquiries should be directed to the Salt Lake City Police Department.""",crime,Salt Lake Tribune,right
"British paper apologizes to Melania Trump, pays 'substantial damages' over article","London's Daily Telegraph apologized to first lady Melania Trump on Saturday and said it had agreed to pay her ""substantial damages"" for publishing false statements regarding her family and her modeling career. ""We apologise unreservedly to The First Lady and her family for any embarrassment caused by our publication of these allegations,"" the newspaper wrote Saturday. ""As a mark of our regret we have agreed to pay Mrs. Trump substantial damages as well as her legal costs."" The claims appeared last week in a cover story in its Saturday Magazine entitled ""The Mystery of Melania."" The conservative British newspaper said the article should not have made the claim that Melania Trump was struggling in her modeling career before she met Donald Trump nor that she had advanced in her career due to his help. ""We accept that Mrs. Trump was a successful professional model in her own right before she met her husband and obtained her own modeling work without his assistance, "" the Telegraph said. The newspaper also said she did not leave her design and architecture course at her university because of anything to do with completing her exam, as alleged in the article, ""but rather because she wanted to pursue a successful career as a professional model."" The apology also stated that the future first lady met Donald Trump in 1998, not in 1996, as it had published, and also wrongly claimed that her mother, father and sister had relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Trump. ""They did not,"" the newspaper said. The Telegraph also cleaned up a couple of additional points: • ""Mrs Trump's father was not a fearsome presence and did not control the family.

'Tan Mom' Patricia Krentcil Says She Was 'Proclaimed Dead' During Recent Health Scare,"Patricia Krentcil, aka Tan Mom, opened up on The Howard Stern Show about her recent health scare. Earlier this month, Patricia collapsed and was hospitalized for complications from pneumonia and had to be placed in a medically-induced coma. She told Howard Stern she is feeling better and also plans to quit smoking. Patricia Krentcil (a.k.a. 'Tan Mom') was reportedly in placed in a medically-induced coma earlier this month, and now, she's opening up about her experience and the health issues that led to it. In a new interview with Howard Stern on The Howard Stern Show Monday, Patricia said she wanted to clear some things up about her hospitalization. ""I speak for myself,"" Patricia said. Patricia then explained a few details about her hospitalization: ""This is the scariest thing I've ever been through,"" she said. ""I was in a coma, literally, for two weeks. My body completely went into a state of shock."" The New York Post reported on Patricia's medically-induced coma earlier in June after she reportedly collapsed on the street in Brandon, Florida. After being rushed to Brandon Regional Hospital, she was treated for pneumonia and serious complications. ""I had a breakdown in my body. My whole system just collapsed,"" she said. The New York Post also reported that her lungs were weak and filled with fluid, and when doctors were unable to drain it Patricia went into cardiac arrest. She was then placed in a medically-induced coma. ""My whole body died. I was proclaimed dead,"" Patricia said. ""It was so sad."" During and following her hospitalization, Patricia's husband, Richard Krentcil, shared multiple updates on Patricia's condition to Twitter. One recent update included a photo of Patricia walking outside. He also thanked fans. ""Thanks support Patricia recovering and is thankful for everyone's prays and well wishes,"" Richard wrote.

The test dummies have arrived at Kennywood and are in the Steel Curtain's cars,"It's all downhill from here for finishing the Steel Curtain, the record-setting roller coaster at Kennywood Park in West Mifflin. This past Friday, the final piece of tubular track was installed to complete the loop on the coaster, which will have the most inversions   nine   of any North American coaster, including the world's tallest inversion at 197 feet, and will be Pennsylvania's tallest coaster at 220 feet. The last piece of track is where riders will turn upside down on that highest inversion. If you're afraid of heights, don't watch the video Kennywood posted on YouTube. There's now 4,000 feet of contiguous track, confirmed Kennywood spokesman Nick Paradise. ""Erection is complete. Everything is up in place. Now it's just that final tightening and torquing"" of bolts, including for a final crossbar. The cars are on the track, and test dummies are in the cars, so at some point soon, they'll begin testing the ride. Doing 1,000 test runs is ""a benchmark to hit,"" Mr. Paradise said, but the park may run more   some with full loads, some with partial loads, covering a range of variables to ensure a quality and safe experience. ""From there it's a several-week process,"" he said. He realizes that some coaster enthusiasts are very impatient to be able to ride the ride, but safety remains paramount. From the perspective of how much that corner of the park has changed in less than two years, the new ride and its adjacent Steelers Country have come a long way and, ""We're getting closer every single day."" He noted that the park has said it would open in the summer of 2019 and, ""We continue to be on pace with that.""

Councilwoman Darlene Harris disapproves of process to pay $45K in city ethics legal fees,"Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Darlene Harris on Wednesday took issue with the city's process of paying $45,000 in legal fees for ethics hearings   some of which focused on her refusal to file local campaign finance reports. The two resolutions   to approve $30,000 for David Berardinelli and $15,000 for retired Judge William F. Ward, who respectively served as prosecutor and hearing officer for the board   received a negative recommendation from council's standing committee. ""I do not have any kind of gain from any of this. I'm making sure council knows that publicly,"" Ms. Harris said during discussion, adding that she took issue with a private executive session held Tuesday to discuss the legal payments. ""The councilwoman is expressing legitimate concerns about the administration's use of an executive session on matters of payment without adequate explanation as to why such matters could not be adequately addressed at an open council session in the public eye,"" said her attorney Jim Burn, of the Downtown Abes Baumann firm. The mayor's office maintains that the resolutions for budgeted payments ""aren't about [Harris'] hearing before the board or fanciful claims about executive sessions,"" said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman. Ms. Harris refused to file her local campaign finance reports. Council passed campaign finance regulations in 2015. Mr. Burn said the city's ""restrictive"" campaign finance regulations violate state preemption law. Of the 11 times the board has met in 2019, two were hearings regarding an ""alleged March 1, 2019, campaign finance violation,"" according to meeting records. The body's findings have not yet been released. ""Mayor Peduto believes it is absolutely necessary to have an independent Ethics Board that is free from interference by any elected official, including the mayor or members of City Council. To be fully independent the board needs its own legal counsel, just as the Citizen Police Review Board does,"" Mr. McNulty said. Five council members abstained from Wednesday's committee vote. President Bruce Kraus, and members Ricky Burgess and Daniel Lavelle voted in favor. Councilman Corey O'Connor was absent. Mr. Burgess said the board ""needs legal support.""

"More oversight needed for addiction recovery houses, Controller Chelsa Wagner says","In an audit released Wednesday, Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner said the county Department of Human Services failed to provide sufficient oversight of addiction recovery houses, resulting in providers failing to meet standards and obtain the necessary permits. The audit examines four contracts awarded following a 2017 request for proposals, with East End Cooperative Ministry, FamilyLinks, Three Rivers Youth, and Clean and Sober Humans. A recovery house is a ""safe, sober, supportive, drug- and alcohol-free living environment that promotes recovery from alcohol and other drug use, and associated problems,"" the audit says, citing DHS. The housing can serve as a transition between inpatient treatment or incarceration and independent living. The audit found that while the county evaluated proposals and awarded contracts based on its initial RFP, it did not include the RFP in the contracts or monitor sufficiently to ensure compliance with them or with state and local regulations. In a response included with the audit, DHS Director Marc Cherna wrote, ""The RFP was a document that contained aspirational goals that ideally, DHS would seek from providers performing these services. Any goals or measures contained in the RFP were never meant to be absolute requirements; if so, the RFP would have been incorporated into the contract."" Ms. Wagner, in her response, called it ""inappropriate and arbitrary"" to set standards in an RFP and then not require compliance with them. The audit highlighted the county's failure to ensure its contracts were going to properly permitted providers. This resulted in Three Rivers Youth suspending its services due to a failure to get a needed zoning variance from the city. ""DHS did not require providers to submit copies of applicable permits and licenses, but rather placed reliance on the provider to ensure all applicable permits and licenses were obtained,"" according to the audit. The audit also criticizes DHS for overpaying a little over $5,000 to three providers, not enforcing performance metrics from the RFP, not conducting site visits, and otherwise allowing the providers to stray from the RFP requirements. Specific deficiencies cited by the controller included providers not drug- or alcohol-testing residents, not training staff to administer opioid overdose-treatment Narcan and being understaffed. ""DHS failed to conduct a site visit to any of the Recovery Housing providers awarded a contract under the 2017 RFP, as required by the [Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs] Treatment Manual,"" said the audit. ""Recovery Housing are not services that should be rigidly standardized. Recovery is a very challenging, lifelong journey, and unfortunately it is expected that relapse will occur for many,"" said Mr. Cherna in his response. ""Spending taxpayer money without clear expectations or accountability is always unacceptable, but when we are dealing with the lives of vulnerable members of our community, that performance benchmarks are not being clearly articulated much less met is truly distressing,"" Ms. Wagner said in a press release.

Penn Hills officials outline plans to fight illegal dumping,"Penn Hills officials on Wednesday detailed a new initiative to end illegal dumping in the community. Proposed solutions to the problem include continuing investigations into suspected perpetrators, keeping known dump sites clean, increased fines and increased signage making clear the punishment for dumping. ""I think there's a lot of angry people. I know I'm angry about it,"" said Penn Hills municipal Manager Scott Andrejchak. Mr. Andrejchak presented several clips filmed in May on a surveillance camera located on Beechford Road showing people unloading an entire U-Haul truck full of trash, including a bike, scrap metal, furniture and several garbage bags. Another video from the same camera, also from May, showed two people unloading a car full of trash, including a toilet. One individual shown in the videos was later identified as Ricky Stallworth Jr. of Wilkinsburg, who was cited with the newly increased fine of $2,000 plus cleanup costs. The other violators seen in the videos are still unidentified. Part of the reason for attacking illegal dumping head-on is the cleanup cost, Mr. Andrejchak said. Cleanup can cost $500 per dumpster filled; the trash accumulated at Beechford Road could fill four or five dumpsters, Mr. Andrejchak said. He estimated the cost of illegal dumping in Penn Hills at $325,000 to $500,000 annually. On top of the cost, Mr. Andrejchak listed other problems like reduced property value; pollution of water; and land and fire hazards. Failing to clean dump sites could also encourage more dumping in the area. ""It lowers the human spirit,"" Mr. Andrejchak said, and it has grown beyond what volunteers are able to clean. The first site where Penn Hills tested the cleanup strategy was the Ross Street Park, located near the corner of Kemler Street and Ross Road, because of its proximity to the playground. That site is now cleaned up, Mr. Andrejchak said, which leaves nine identified sites in need of cleanup. Beechford Road is the next on the list. ""This isn't business as usual anymore,"" Mr. Andrejchak said. ""We're taking a completely different attitude and approach to this."" The Environmental Protection Agency says it's difficult to profile the ""typical"" illegal dumper, but it lists construction and landscaping contractors, auto repair and tire shops, scrap collectors and local ""do-it-yourselfers"" as frequent offenders. Hazards from dumping can include disease-carrying mosquitoes attracted to tire piles, flooding due to blocked drainage and contaminated drinking water caused by toxic runoff, according to the EPA. In order to form a successful illegal dumping program, the EPA says programs must be founded on leadership and support by local officials, and by encouraging cooperation between authorities, citizens and industries. Mr. Andrejchak guaranteed that the dumping would stop, but urged the public to be patient in the process.

Workers wanted: Allegheny County lags in gearing up for career-focused jobs,"Allegheny County students remain under-enrolled in career and technical education programs even though they can lead to rewarding, family-sustaining jobs that employers will be struggling to fill. That's the main takeaway of a new report from the Pittsburgh nonprofit Allies for Children. The report should be viewed as a companion or follow-up to a pair of Allegheny Conference on Community Development studies, one issued in 2016 and the other last year, warning that the region will be short as many as 80,000 workers by 2025. Many of those openings will be in positions that don't require four-year college degrees but do require the kind of specialized training provided by high school and postgraduate CTE. Allies for Children and the Allegheny Conference both noted low student enrollment, funding challenges and other problems with CTE programs. Three years after the conference's initial report, it's clear the CTE landscape isn't changing quickly enough, with potentially grave repercussions for workers and the region. Only 8% of Allegheny County high school students are enrolled in CTE programs, compared to about 13% statewide, according to Allies for Children. Parity would require another 2,400 students to enroll in the county's CTE programs. The report noted that Forbes Road Career and Technology Center in Monroeville has fewer students now than 10 years ago. The region has lost population, so that is likely a contributing factor. However, with training in advanced manufacturing, automotive technology, building construction technology, warehouse management and computer network security, among other programs directly bearing on the region's growing economy, the school should be bursting at the seams. Allies for Children calls for more outreach so that students, parents and K-12 teachers better appreciate the potential value of CTE. Utterly laughable is the lingering notion that CTE is for students who can't make it in other educational settings. Forbes Road says students in its advanced manufacturing program ""will read blueprints"" and ""cut, shape and finish metal products on state'Äêof'Äêthe'Äêart manual and computer-controlled machines."" None of that sounds easy. Exposure to CTE should start as early as possible   no later than middle school   and promotion of these programs should include employment projections so students can make sound plans for their future. State and local governments should make the necessary investment in CTE programs   especially equipment   so students can hit the ground running after graduation. Also, as Allies for Children and the Allegheny Conference have noted, schools and employers should work together to develop a workforce for CTE-related jobs that are open now or at risk of going unfilled in the future.",education,Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,right
Official: Mt. Lebanon deer management program has prevented almost 300 accidents,"The number of deer-vehicle collisions in Mt. Lebanon has steadily declined in recent years. That was the assessment made by Ian McMeans, municipal assistant manager/planner during a presentation to commissioners Tuesday on the municipality's deer management program. Mt. Lebanon uses both sharpshooters and archery hunters to cull the deer population. In 2014, the municipality set a goal to reduce deer-vehicle collisions by 50%. In 2013-14, there were 44 deer-vehicle collisions, but that number spiked in 2016 to 122. In 2016, the municipality started contracting with sharpshooters who are granted special authority by the state Game Commission. The next year, collisions involving deer dropped to 86. In 2018, the number dropped even further to 61. According to municipal mapping information, a majority of deer-related accidents happen on Bower Hill Road near the Scott Township border and in the area of Cedar Boulevard between Robb Hollow Park and Bird Park, Mr. McMeans said during the commissioners' discussion session meeting. ""Generally they are around the large, wooded areas,"" Mr. McMeans said. Mt. Lebanon has spent $296,578 on deer management since 2015 with a total of 466 deer culled   271 through sharpshooting and 195 through archers. The archery season typically runs from September through January, with sharpshooting in February and March. ""We would have likely seen 296 more deer collisions if we had not implemented the program,"" Mr. McMeans said. He said if there were 296 more crashes, that would have cost between $444,000 and $1.2 million   based on the average cost of vehicle damage from a deer-related crash. Mr. McMeans added that even with the cost of the cull, there is a savings to residents because there is less potential for a crash. The municipality also has been able to donate 9,500 pounds of venison to local food pantries, including Bethany Presbyterian Church and the Greater Washington Food Bank, through Hunters Sharing the Harvest. Resident Kimberly Schevtchuk disputed the municipality's claims in the deer management report at the regular commissioners meeting that followed the discussion meeting. ""It is a carefully constructed pseudo-scientific report that grossly exaggerates the findings,"" she said. ""The projected cost savings are entirely misleading,"" she said, adding she wanted to sit down and discuss the findings with municipal officials. The commissioners asked Ms. Schevtchuk to put her complaints in writing, but she declined.

Two bald eagle nestlings fledge at Hays,"Like babies taking their first steps, the bald eagle nestlings of Hays have completed their first flights. The first to fledge stepped off a branch June 11. The second's awkward initial flight occurred June 16. A third egg laid in February cracked and failed to hatch. Rachel Handel, spokeswoman for the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, said both Hays fledges were considered successful. A live-streaming camera operated by CSE and Audubon shows the nest occasionally empty for the first time since the eggs were laid. ""The eaglets will continue to return to the nest, and have been seen back in the nest, until they leave for good to find their own new territories,"" said Ms. Handel. The resourceful parents have nested on the same steep hillside overlooking the Monongahela River in Hays since 2013. In that time they've rebuilt their nest three times, once when its tree collapsed in a windstorm. They've had just one unsuccessful nesting season and have fledged 10 eaglets. The birds hang around near the nest for a few weeks before going off on their own. ""Once the birds leave the nest, we don't know where they go,"" said Ms. Handel. ""The first year of life is the most challenging. If bald eagles make it past that first year, statistically they are likely to reach 15-plus years of age."" In five years they establish their own territories, choose a mate and build their first nest. ""They're mature and ready to breed when the feathers on their head have turned completely white,"" she said. ""The immature eagles will not return to the nests where they were born -- this territory belongs to their parents and [they] will actively drive the younger eagles away, even if they happened to be their own offspring."" This year at another Allegheny County bald eagle nest site in Harmar, the parents built a new nest in a tree on the same cliff face but beyond the view of Audubon's live-streaming camera. Audubon staff and volunteers have monitored the nest from the ground. ""The Harmar nest has two successful hatches this year,"" said Ms. Handel. ""The birds are branching and preparing for their first flights."" No camera is mounted over an eagle pair that nested for the first time in North Park this year. Ground observation indicated they didn't hatch an egg. Bald eagle pairs in Cresson and Glassport are not monitored by eagle experts.

""It's a nice place down here,"" said Ms. Brown, who said she appreciates the views of the city, as well as the safety of her one-bedroom apartment. ""The transformation is really great. They way they did this, I really love it,"" she said. The homes are the first phase of a planned redevelopment of one of Pittsburgh's oldest public housing sites, Allegheny Dwellings. The 65 new units are a combination of townhomes, duplexes, and a four-story apartment building; 18 are market-rate, 47 are at various levels of affordability. The new units on Federal Street and Sandusky Court, dubbed Sandstone Quarry, will be privately managed by Trek Development Group. Part of the old, red-brick, barracks-style Allegheny Dwellings still remains nearby, with 175 units on Belleau Drive and Letsche Street. The housing authority plans to redevelop the whole site eventually. Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh officials celebrated the transformation Thursday, along with officials from Trek, the state, county, city, tenant representatives, architect Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, Key Bank, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""I never thought in a million years it would look like this,"" said Allegheny Dwellings Tenant Council President Cheryl Gainey. The hillside site has the ""most spectacular views in the city,"" declared Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. ""I'm an East End guy, but I can see crossing a river for this,"" he said. The new housing aimed to connect community, in what had previously been a somewhat isolated site, due to the history of building public housing in the city on hilltops that were cut off from other neighborhoods, said Ken Doyno, president of Rothschild Doyno Collaborative. ""That isolation hurt everybody,"" he said, and the new design aims to better connect the site to the rest of Fineview and the Central North Side. The Sandstone Quarry name is a nod to the site's history as a quarry, prior to it being housing, he explained. Residents of the old Allegheny Dwellings on Sandusky Court moved out starting in 2016 to make way for the redevelopment . They were offered spots at other public housing sites, or a Housing Choice Voucher to rent an apartment on the private rental market. To date, 15 former residents have moved into the new units. An additional 11 have been deemed eligible by HACP. ""Everybody was offered options,"" said Michelle Sandidge, chief community affairs officer for the housing authority. Market rate units at Sandstone Quarry are being advertised for 1- and 2-bedroom apartments from $875/month and 3-bedroom townhomes at $1,375/month.

Ruling: Highmark members lose UPMC access June 30,"Highmark insurance members will no longer have discount access to many UPMC doctors after June 30, a Commonwealth Court judge ruled Friday in what is unlikely to be the last word in the bitter divorce of warring Pittsburgh-based health care systems. Judge Robert Simpson ruled the consent decrees that guided business relations between Highmark and UPMC for nearly five years ends June 30, closing the doors to UPMC doctors for thousands of people in Western Pennsylvania who have Highmark health coverage. An appeal of the decision to the state Supreme Court is expected   the second time in as many months the issue will come before the justices. The state attorney general and Highmark officials ""cannot state a cause of action for extension of the termination/expiration provision of the consent decrees,"" Judge Simpson wrote. Judge Simpson's ruling comes eight days after UPMC unexpectedly announced that it would continue allowing in-network access for Highmark members after June 30 to three UPMC specialty hospitals, including Children's Hospital in Lawrenceville. UPMC specialty hospital access for Highmark members had been a bitterly divisive issue in public hearings in the Pittsburgh area that were conducted in recent months by Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner. The state Supreme Court last heard an appeal of the agreement's runout date on May 16 before ruling in a 4-3 decision May 28 to return the issue to Commonwealth Court to decide. Judge Simpson heard two days of arguments in the case June 10-11 in Harrisburg. The issue of when the consent decrees expire was first raised in February by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who filed a four-count civil lawsuit against UPMC for allegedly violating its nonprofit tax-exempt status in excluding Highmark members from access to institutions that public and philanthropic dollars helped build. In court papers, UPMC lawyers said the attorney general was exceeding his authority in trying to get UPMC to accept Highmark members and replace UPMC's board. During the two days of hearings earlier this week, UPMC lawyer Leon F. DeJulius from the law office of Jones Day argued that the consent decrees were never intended to be extended indefinitely. Moreover, the attorney general had not provided independent evidence that the consent decrees' modification clause included an extension. ""This was not a document negotiated for an indefinite extension,"" Mr. DeJulius told the court. ""There's not one document that supports the attorney general's case."" In earlier testimony, executive deputy general James Donahue said the Highmark-UPMC agreement was the first time in his 34-year career with the attorney general's office that an extension had been sought. However, the extension was justified by serving the public interest, where Highmark members   some critically ill   would be forced to find new doctors outside UPMC. The attorney general's lawsuit seeks a UPMC mandate to reach agreements with ""any willing insurer,"" an idea that legal experts say is without precedent. Kris B.

City will now protect gender identity and expression,"Discrimination of a person because of gender identity or gender expression is now prohibited in matters of employment, housing and public accommodations in city limits, after Pittsburgh City Council gave unanimous final approval to amending the city's discrimination code Tuesday. Council members Erika Strassburger and President Bruce Kraus introduced the measure to strengthen the city code on June 25, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York City. The city's Commission on Human Relations enforces the code. ""The [commission] is pleased that city council has affirmed the need to expand discrimination protections for sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression with their votes today,"" said Megan Stanley, the commission's interim director. ""This update to city code makes discrimination on any of these grounds an unlawful practice ... and has updated the definitions of these terms to make them more inclusive."" Council also unanimously approved two ordinances refining competitive bidding and contract approvals, both of which have been held in committee for nearly a year and for five months, respectively. One ordinance now outlines procedures in the case of a tie between the lowest bidders as well as a process for bidders to protest a contract awarded for the purchase of commodities or services in excess of $50,000. The change was recommended by the Law Department, according to Ms. Strassburger, who co-sponsored the bills. A second ordinance, which goes into effect in 60 days, amends the required information provided to council about recommended contractors. Council will now receive a list of contractors that responded to the solicitation; names and qualifications of the recommended contractors; an Equal Opportunity Review Commission review; among other pieces of information. ""This allows council to have more information so we don't have to ask every single time, 'Who were the other bidders? How did you make your decision? Has it gone through the EORC process?,'"" said Ms. Strassburger. The changes are part of a ""larger effort"" to tackle procurement in a ""more holistic way,"" she said. City Controller Michael Lamb released an audit of the city's procurement process in May . Council also approved two contract agreements on Tuesday   $255,912 over five years for a new database system for the City Clerk's office and $1.8 million for landscape construction on Wightman Park in Squirrel Hill. The city broke ground on the 1.8-acre park on Solway Street in Ms. Strassburger's district in April , but there have been delays in finalizing the plans as stormwater issues have been considered. ""If we're going to do it, we wanted to do it right,"" Ms. Strassburger said. Plans for the park include a water filtration and storage system under the baseball field as well as accessible playground equipment, including a wheelchair swing, and restrooms that have both child- and adult-diaper changing tables for those with special needs.

Rollins declines prosecution of 18 ICE protesters,"Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins said her office won't pursue charges against the 18 protesters arrested Tuesday outside the Boston ICE detention center. ""I believe that challenges to ICE's actions are most effectively effectuated in court,"" Rollins said in a statement. ""The protesters' peaceful challenge of the inhumane detention policies of the Trump administration is protected by the First Amendment."" Through the ""Never Again Action"" group, hundreds of protesters Tuesday marched from the New England Holocaust Memorial to the Suffolk County House of Correction, where ICE houses some of its detainees. Protesters called for the end of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, closure of the border camps and to abolish ICE. Cata Santiago, community organizer for Movimiento Cosecha, said the 18 arrested were from the Jewish community, who ""expressed their solidarity for the broad immigrant community through their arrests."" ""It was a way to set the example of what it means to care for and respect the immigrant community,"" Santiago said, describing how the 18 locked arms and sat on the building's steps. Santiago said Rollins' refusal to prosecute demonstrated that politicians are beginning to show their support and that it ""spoke volumes."" Maddy Popkin, with the Boston Workmen's Circle Center for Jewish Culture and Social Justice, confirmed that some of those arrested were from their organization. ""We feel that we can't be complacent and sit and wait for change because we the people have the power to demand and enact change,"" Popkin said when asked about the arrests, adding that it was important for the Jewish community to stand with immigrants because they knew what it was like ""to be persecuted and families torn apart"" when immigrating to the United States. ""So we marched and inherited the fight of our ancestors,"" Popkin said. Lily Fisher Gomberg, who said she was one of the 18 protesters arrested Tuesday, said she commends Rollins on her decision. ""As activists, we protested peacefully, did not resist arrest, and did not have past charges. There would have been no reason to process our charges,"" Gomberg wrote in a statement to the Herald. Gomberg said that when the case was dismissed, many of the activists ""cried tears of relief and pride.""",politics,Boston Herald,right
Ilhan Omar fined by state for unlawful use of campaign funds,"R ep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has to personally pay a fine for multiple violations of the state's campaign finance laws. The Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board ordered the freshman Democrat to personally pay a $500 civil fine along with paying back $3,469 to her Minnesota statehouse campaign after she unlawfully used funds for multiple personal expenses. The board required Omar to repay $2,250 she had been reimbursed for law firm invoices for her immigration records and personal tax returns. The report said the law firm was tied to a ""crisis committee"" which was created to defend her against allegations that the congresswoman had married her brother in an immigration scheme. In addition, the board found that on five different occasions that Omar paid for travel and hotel expenses on out-of-state trips in 2017, including a rally for a local candidate in Boston, that Omar had ""categorized as expenses of serving in public office."" The investigation started in 2018 after Minnesota GOP state Rep. Steve Drazkowski filed a complaint to the board. ""This just really adds on to the litany of disrespect for the law that Rep. Omar has,"" Drazkowski told the Washington Examiner after the board's report was released Thursday. ""You have eight violations here."" Drazkowski, who filed multiple complaints, called Omar ""a serial violator of the law"" who had no hesitation when it came to trampling on campaign finance rules. Omar said in a statement she would comply with the board's fine. ""I'm glad this process is complete and that the Campaign Finance Board has come to a resolution on this matter. We have been collaborative in this process and are glad the report showed that none of the money was used for personal use, as was initially alleged,"" Omar said. She also said she plans to close the account from the state race and give the money to organizations that help first-time candidates ""so that the next generation of candidates and their teams know how to adequately track and report campaign expenses.""",legal arguments,Washington Examiner,right
"House GOP leader sides with AOC on pay hike, says Congress at risk of being only for millionaires","Name a topic, and chances are good that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., are on opposite sides. But now McCarthy appears to agree with AOC that members of Congress deserve a pay raise. Without a salary increase, McCarthy says, only millionaires will be able to serve. The top Republican in the House made the comments this week as lawmakers scrapped the bill over the possible backlash from increasing salaries for themselves and their staffs. ""When you talk this subject about COLA, a cost-of-living increase, it does invoke an emotion, kind of an impulsive emotion,"" McCarthy told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner . ""I think it's one that we should pause and look at. It's been more than 10 years in the process. The current study says that pay has decreased by 15 percent. I do not want Congress at the end of the day to only be a place that millionaires serve. This should be a body of the people."" Members of Congress generally make $174,000 per year, with senior leaders earning more, and no cost-of-living adjustments have been made in the past nine years. Last month, some vulnerable swing-state Democrats, concerned how the proposed $4,500 pay hike would look if it didn't also have Republican support, had signed onto amendments rejecting a similar measure to increase their pay. McCarthy's comments echoed previous remarks by Ocasio-Cortez, who argued that lawmakers deserve the increase, otherwise the politicians will turn to lobbying. ""It's not even like a raise,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. She called opposition to the pay increase ""superficial. ... This is why there's so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on member service after people leave, because precisely of this issue."" The Congressional Research Service (CRS) found in May that, adjusted for inflation, salaries for members of Congress ""have decreased 15 percent since the last pay adjustment in 2009."" Following a cost-of-living adjustment formula established in 2009, members of Congress should currently be making $210,900, the CRS found.",politics,Washington Examiner,right
Jury convicts East Hills mom in daughter's fentanyl sippy cup death,"A jury Tuesday afternoon found an East Hills mother guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the fentanyl poisoning death last year of her 17-month-old daughter, who ingested the lethal drug by drinking from a sippy cup . Jhenea Pratt, 23, was also found guilty of endangering the welfare of children. Jurors rejected convicting Ms. Pratt of first- or third-degree murder. A sentencing date has not yet been set by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark V. Tranquilli. The jury of nine men and three women got the case Monday afternoon and resumed deliberations Tuesday morning. Ms. Pratt was charged with providing a pink sippy cup containing fentanyl   what one detective testified during trial was enough to ""kill two horses""   to her daughter, Charlette Nappery-Talley, on April 5, 2018. ""Jhenea has always maintained that she would never intentionally hurt Charlette,"" her lawyer, Brandon Herring, said. He declined further comment, stating he would have more to say on the day of sentencing. In closing arguments Monday, the prosecution linked Charlette's death to Ms. Pratt's smoking pot. The truth is that Ms. Pratt wanted to ""sit back, relax and smoke marijuana,"" Assistant District Attorney Diana Page told jurors. ""That baby was getting in the way of her enjoying her pastime."" Pittsburgh police discovered a red liquid inside a pink sippy cup on Charlette's bed in her East Hills apartment after responding to a call just after 6 p.m. for a baby who wasn't breathing. Days after Charlette died in the hospital, the Allegheny County medical examiner's office received results from two tests. Both indicated the presence of fentanyl in the toddler's blood, as did another screening in May by an independent lab. The inside of the cup also tested positive for fentanyl, police said, and the medical examiner's office listed Charlette's death as a homicide due to fentanyl poisoning.

Leaked memo reveals Boris Johnson called the French 'turds' in comments censored by the BBC,"Boris Johnson branded the French ""turds"" in comments filmed by the BBC, according to a leaked memo. However, the UK government successfully persuaded the broadcaster to remove the footage from a documentary about his time at the Foreign Office. Officials argued that airing the comments would do significant damage to Anglo-French relations. Johnson is the strong favourite to replace Theresa May as prime minister. Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories. LONDON - Boris Johnson branded the French ""turds"" in remarks that the UK government successfully persuaded the BBC to remove from a documentary about his work at the Foreign Office. The former Foreign Secretary was filmed making the comments in relation to the French government's Brexit position, according to a leaked government memo seen by the Daily Mail. The BBC initially insisted they would broadcast the comments, as part of the documentary Inside the Foreign Office, which was broadcast last year, insisting that they were an accurate portrayal of Johnson at work. However, the Foreign Office successfully argued that Johnson's comments, if aired, would do ""significant damage"" to Anglo-French relations and harm Brexit negotiations. In a memo seen by the Mail, officials note that ""we negotiated the removal of one potentially awkward moment where the former foreign secretary calls the French 'turds' so as not to distract from the rest of the programme."" The BBC then removed the comments from the final edit, but kept in separate comments in which Johnson accused the French of ""shafting"" Britain. Johnson has committed to renegotiating Britain's Brexit deal with the EU if he becomes prime minister at the end of next month. However, the former foreign secretary has long been seen as a divisive figure in Europe, ever since he began his career as a muck-racking European correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in Brussels. Senior EU figures have repeatedly insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May cannot be re-opened. A spokesperson for the BBC said: ""The programme set out to reflect the realities of life inside the Foreign Office, the production team made judgements about what was in the programme and they are satisfied that the programme achieves its ambitions and has the content they wanted.'

Syria Shriners say no circus in Pittsburgh this year,"No elephants, tigers or camels will be headed to the city this fall, as the Shriners Circus has called it quits. ""Well it won't be in the city of Pittsburgh. It wasn't an option for us this year,"" Robert Addleman Jr., corporate secretary and business manager for the Syria Shriners, said Thursday. Stricter animal treatment regulations and an injurious bucking camel at its 2018 circus in Pittsburgh have led up to the big top collapsing for the local Syria Shriners' biggest fundraiser. Mr. Addleman did not say if another location in the region has been chosen. ""Everything's a business decision, so I can't say for sure that we will hold the circus in another location, and I also can't say that the circus is done for,"" he said. Proceeds from the circus, held almost every year in Pittsburgh for nearly seven decades, benefit the local fraternal order, including its philanthropic efforts for the national Shriners Hospitals for Children. The local show draws roughly 30,000 people for fives shows over several days. ""Some years have been better than others,"" Mr. Addelman said, adding that the organization usually expected to make $100,000 or more. At the circus' last Pittsburgh showing in September 2018, a startled camel that began bucking during a session of free rides injured six children and one adult   causing a broken arm for one of the children. A federal inspector found no violations during its inspection of the incident. The Shriners' 2018 Pittsburgh circus went on thanks to a judge's one-time exception, despite Pittsburgh lawmakers enacting stricter animal treatment regulations in December 2017. The ordinance restricts anyone in Pittsburgh from using pain-inducing or -threatening devices, like bullhooks or electric prods, on wild or exotic animals. Circus insurance carriers require the presence of bullhooks   a pointed hook on a long handle   to guide elephants, Mr. Addelson said. The organization maintains that animals at their circus do not face pain or harm. In 2018, Mayor Bill Peduto urged Shriners to continue their tradition, but without ""instruments that cause pain and injury to the animals they use as entertainment."" The mayor's office did not have comment on the Shrine Circus leaving city limits. National animal rights organization PETA said it supports the Syria Shriners' decision. ""PETA applauds the Shriners' decision to join the growing number of temples that are leaving elephants, camels, and other animals out of their fundraisers,"" said Rachel Mathews, the advocacy organizations' deputy director of captive animal law enforcement. Circus acts and animal performers have fallen out of public favor in recent years due to a number of factors, including animal welfare concerns. Ringling Brothers took its final bow in 2017 .

PennDOT tells Ross officials that Reis Run slide has top priority,"There currently are 95 landslides affecting roads in the local area, but the slide at Reis Run Road has top priority, the District 11 executive for the state Department of Transportation told Ross commissioners and several residents affected by the closure of the road. Cheryl Moon-Sirianni was invited to Monday's meeting to address the landslide, which is occurring on private property. The deputy director of the agency signed an emergency proclamation Monday, which will cut red tape in dealing with the landslide. If the property owner signs a document allowing PennDOT to fix the slide, the state will do the work and place a lien on the property for repayment. Ross has condemned the house, and the property owner has moved. If the property owner does not give permission, the state will have to go through condemnation proceedings, which will take longer, Ms. Moon-Sirianni said. The proclamation also allows PennDOT to take money from other projects to pay for the work. Still, Ms. Moon-Sirianni said, workers cannot do anything until the earth stops moving. ""Every time it rains, the slide moves a little bit more. At this point in time, we are not comfortable…with opening this because of the safety of the traveling public,"" she said. ""Anybody using the road is putting themselves in jeopardy."" George Groff, who spoke for the nearby neighborhoods, told commissioners that 450 to 500 houses and approximately 1,000 cars were affected by the closure of Reis Run on May 31. ""I witnessed a 1.6-mile, bumper-to-bumper gridlock coming off (Interstate) 279 on Mt. Nebo (Road) to go up to Arndt Road,"" he said.

Coding camp keeps students engaged while learning necessary skills,"It was a beautiful June day, but about 120 fourth through eighth graders willingly spent the day in a classroom working on laptop computers. The students from across the region were learning to code in Python or Java, two types of computer programming language, and were taking part in a free coding camp started last year by three North Allegheny high school students. ""We just came up with the idea last winter because we wanted something to do in the summer that was fun and exciting,"" said Akshana Dassanaike-Perera. Akshana founded Steel City Codes with friends Josh Zhou and Claire Shao. Akshana and Josh will be seniors next year, while Claire will be a junior. ""During winter, we saw a bunch of kids that were interested in programming, but did not have experience,"" Josh said. ""Most kids struggled with coding."" So the trio decided to find a way to teach coding to younger students so they will not struggle with it in high school. Last year's camp held at Marshall Middle School had one session with 80 students in grades four through eight. This year, the camp has three sessions, each with 120-140 students from seven school districts, and is being held at North Allegheny Intermediate High School in McCandless. Josh said some students signed up for all three sessions, taking a different class each time. The remaining sessions are from July 15-19 and July 29-Aug. 2. Both are at capacity. There are four classes, two each in Java and Python, and two sections of each class. Each class has three high school students who have volunteered to teach the younger students. ""This is all student-run. These are students teaching students,"" said Emily Shaffer, North Allegheny public relations and communications specialist. ""They are using their summer break to give back to other students."" A lecture on a point of the coding programs is explained, and then the students work collaboratively to solve problems, Josh said. Students work on North Allegheny laptops, and are required to bring a lunch. Any student who receives a free or reduced lunch during the school year will receive a free lunch, thanks to several corporate sponsors. ""We wanted to make sure that those that are underserved have access to computer science,"" Akshana said. U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, spoke to students the first day of the camp about the importance of computer skills. A representative of Tesla also will provide a demonstration. ""We give them frequent breaks. They can run around after lunch. We felt that helps a lot,"" Akshana said. ""We keep the kids constantly entertained."" Akshana and Josh would like to see Steel City Codes continue after they graduate and move on to college. They also would like to see the camp expand to other cities, especially those considered underserved. A lot of cities are as much or more underserved as Pittsburgh is,"" Akshana said.

horses in weld county test positive for vesicular stomatitis,"BROOMFIELD, Colo.   Two horses in Weld County tested positive July 3 for vesicular stomatitis. Two other states, New Mexico and Texas, reported confirmed cases this year, according to a news release from the Colorado Department of Agriculture. The horses, which live in two different parts of Weld County, have been placed under quarantine. Vesicular stomatitis primarily affects horses and cattle, and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas, according to the release. The transmission process is not completely understood, but black flies, sand flies, and biting midges could be carriers. Signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats, and coronary bands. According to the release, excessive salivation is often the first sign of disease, along with a reluctance to eat or drink. Lameness and weight loss may follow. Although humans can become infected when handling the affected animals, it rarely occurs. To avoid human exposure, people should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals. Colorado State Veterinarian Keith Roehr completed the initial investigation into the cases. ""Vesicular stomatitis can be painful for animals and costly to their owners,"" Roehr said, in the release. ""The virus typically causes oral blisters and sores that can be painful causing difficulty in eating and drinking."" Insects were likely carrying the disease, and mitigation efforts are underway to reduce the chance the virus will spread, according to the release. The horses will be under quarantine until at least 14 days after the onset of lesions. No United States Department of Agriculture-approved vaccines exist for vesicular stomatitis. The Weld County epidemiological investigation indicates an incursion of VSV-infected insect vectors is the likely source of infection. Biosecurity measures and vector mitigation have been instituted on both locations to reduce the potential spread of the virus. The animals are being monitored daily and the index premises will remain under state quarantine until at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last affected animal on the premises. There are no USDA approved vaccines for VSV. The following are tips for livestock owners from the Colorado Department of Agriculture: Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease. Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools or health care equipment from other herds. Colorado veterinarians and livestock owners should contact the state of destination when moving livestock interstate to ensure that all import requirements are met. Contact information for all state veterinarian offices is listed here . Colorado fairs, livestock exhibitions, and rodeos may institute new entry requirements based on the extent and severity of the current VS outbreak. Certificates of veterinary inspection issued within 2-5 days prior to an event can be beneficial in reducing risks. Be sure to stay informed of any new livestock event requirements. See the Vesicular Stomatitis Guidelines for Shows and Fairs. Important Points for Veterinarians Report any vesicular disease to the State Veterinarian's Office in Colorado at 303-869-9130.

Bernie Sanders will introduce Tuesday a resolution declaring a climate change emergency, a move that comes after the Green New Deal failed to take off the ground earlier this year. The resolution, also co-sponsored by Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer, will call for a wide-scale mobilization to combat the emergency and restore the climate ""for future generations."" GREEN NEW DEAL FAILS SENATE TEST VOTE AS DOZENS OF DEMOCRATS VOTE 'PRESENT' ""The global warming caused by human activities,"" claims the draft resolution, according to the Mother Jones magazine, ""has resulted in a climate emergency that … demands a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale."" Ocasio-Cortez and Blumenauer, meanwhile, also wrote to fellow members of Congress urging them to declare climate change an emergency in a bid to ""swiftly mobilize federal resources in response."" The resolution, according to the outlet, details how climate change impacts public health and national security of the U.S., though it doesn't make any exact recommendations how to address the so-called emergency. The latest declaration comes after Ocasio-Cortez's signature Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic proposal for dealing with climate change, failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate back in March, with 42 Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voting ""present."" OCASIO-CORTEZ ASSAILS BIDEN'S 'MIDDLE GROUND' CLIMATE CHANGE PLAN, SAYS IT'S 'DEALBREAKER' Both the New York Democrat and her colleagues decried Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's move to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote, saying the Republicans purposely rushed the vote while McConnell only wanted Democrats to go on record to support the sweeping proposal that he himself called ""a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy."" The Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. Republicans have railed against the proposal, saying it would devastate the economy and trigger massive tax increases. It remains unclear how the new resolution differs from the Green New Deal, though a spokesperson for Sanders told the magazine that unlike President Trump's emergencies, the climate change declaration warrants the use of emergency powers.

Trump: Iran 'better be careful' after backing away further from nuclear deal,"President Trump lobbed a strong warning to Iran on Sunday after the rogue nation announced it had ratcheted up its uranium enrichment beyond the limit allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. ""Iran better be careful. … Iran is doing a lot of bad things,"" Trump said. ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon."" Iran has said it was inching its program closer toward weapons-grade levels, while calling for a diplomatic solution to a crisis that has raised tensions with the U.S. ""Iran's latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions. Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran's nuclear program. Iran's regime, armed with nuclear weapons, would pose an even greater danger to the world,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. Iran's move, coupled with abandoning the deal's limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile earlier, has intensified pressure as the future of the accord, signed during the Obama administration remains in question. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal last year. He added Sunday, ""the Obama agreement... was the most foolish agreement that you will ever find."" Iranian officials said the new level of uranium enrichment would be reached later in the day, but did not provide the percentage they planned to hit. Under the nuclear deal, the cap for enrichment was set at 3.67 percent, a percentage closely monitored by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. ""Within hours, the technical tasks will be done and enrichment above 3.67 percent will begin,"" Iran nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said. ""We predict that the IAEA measurements early tomorrow morning will show that we have gone beyond 3.67 percent."" While Iran's recent measures could be easily reversed, Europe has struggled to respond, even after getting a 60-day warning that the increase was coming. In a statement, the United Kingdom said: ""Iran has broken the terms of the (Iran deal), following its announcement that it will start uranium enrichment above the 3.67 percent limit agreed in the nuclear deal.

latin american festivals you've never tried,"This story was originally published in 2014. Festival dates will have changed. Last year, Lainie Liberti and her teenager decided to fly down to Latin America and see the real Peru. Be careful what you ask for. Just to reach the site for the Qoylllur Rit'i festival, the Californian single mom and her son had to hire a guide and begin the journey uphill into the Andes. Six hours   and many meters   later, the two reached a mountainous peak and found a valley below full of Andean peasants setting up tents for the annual three-day extravaganza. In the end, thousands would attend to watch a sea of colorful religious processions of pilgrims in traditional garb of feathers and streamers, some carrying blocks of ice from nearby glaciers thought to possess medicinal qualities. In keeping with Incan astrology, hundreds watched the sunrise over the surrounding mountains, the event's touchstone event. Liberti says she left in awe, after a ""life-altering experience."" For many travelers, it's one of the best reasons to come to Latin America: the bevy of cultural festivals that range from the rowdy to the mystical. Some of the activities can be pricey   or as Brazilians say, ""salty""   and many are hard to reach, deep in the Amazon or far into the foggy highlands of Guatemala. But as many as 100,000 experience-seekers come to these celebrations, which include everything from ""flying pole dancers"" to loinclothed triathlon racers. Below, our guide to some of the more unique and memorable events in 2015 that deserve a special shout-out, far from the madding crowds of Carnaval: A fancy-dressed man participates in the Qoyllur Rit'i religious festival.

A scantily clad (read: loinclothed) men's triathlon anchors this two-week summertime cultural festival in its 40th year of celebrating the Tapati people. Portions of the festivities include eel fishing and a paddle race across a volcanic lagoon in a canoe weighed down by 55 pounds of bananas. June 15 17: Qoyllur Rit'i in Mahuayani, Peru. The so-called Snow Star Festival is a syncretized religious festival linking Catholic and indigenous histories into a folkloric pop-up tent party in a remote Andean valley. A bit like a high-altitude, cultural Burning Man in this sense, the whole event is timed with the lunar cycle. It attracts tens of thousands of Andean pilgrims each year. June 26: Parintins Folk Festival in Parintins, Brazil. Also known as Boi Bumbá, this cultural festival in the heart of the Amazon is something between a folkloric play and Carnaval, all mixed into one, centered on the legend of two rival oxen. Spectators receive scores, so bring your game face. Dec. 14-21: La Fiesta de Santo Tomás in Chichicastenango, Guatemala. Flying pole dancers, anyone? At this religious festival in the cloudy hills of Chi-Chi, the town's 100,000 K'iche' Maya indigenous people host a celebration for their town's patron saint, Saint Thomas. The highlight of the eight days is the Palo Voador, when acrobats summit the tops of 100-foot wooden poles, tie ropes around their ankles and then swing upside down at high speeds. Dizzying, dazzling. Dec. 23: La Noche de Rábanos (The Night of the Radishes) in Oaxaca, Mexico. So you think you can carve a radish? Well, check out this 118-year-old festival for a reality check. We're talking intricately carved, 6-pound, 20-inch monster radishes here. Imagine it as a Mayan 4-H fair, only Christmas themed, in the Zócalo and with radishes.",legal arguments,Fox News,right

Sotheby's must face Russian billionaire's lawsuit over art fraud - U.S. judge,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York rejected Sotheby's bid to dismiss a $380 million lawsuit where Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev accused the auction house of helping his longtime art dealer's scheme to overcharge him on dozens of masterworks. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said Sotheby's failed to establish that the case did not belong in his court because Rybolovlev was already litigating in Switzerland, where much of the key evidence and many witnesses were located, and that principles of international comity justified dismissal. Furman found no showing that New York was ""genuinely inconvenient"" and Switzerland was ""significantly preferable,"" saying the New York case had made more progress and Sotheby's might save money by defending itself in its home forum. Sotheby's has called Rybolovlev's claims against it baseless. Lawyers for the auction house were not immediately available for comment. A lawyer for Rybolovlev had no immediate comment. The case is part of a multi-year effort by Rybolovlev, 52, to recoup alleged losses he has blamed on the art dealer, Yves Bouvier, who has denied wrongdoing. Litigation has also ensued in France, Monaco and Singapore. Rybolovlev, through his companies Accent Delight International Ltd and Xitrans Finance Ltd, accused Bouvier of overcharging him by more than $1 billion on 38 artworks, for which he paid in excess of $2 billion between 2003 and 2015. According to the New York complaint, Sotheby's had a hand in 14 of the transactions, and had been ""the willing auction house that knowingly and intentionally made the fraud possible"" because it knew how much Bouvier was paying the sellers. The complaint said the artworks included paintings by Amedeo Modigliani, Gustav Klimt and Leonardo da Vinci for which he paid a combined $429.3 million from 2011 to 2013. Rybolovlev sold the da Vinci, ""Salvator Mundi,"" for $450.3 million at Christie's in 2017, making it the most expensive painting ever sold. Forbes magazine on Tuesday estimated Rybolovlev's fortune at $6.8 billion, mainly from his 2010 sale of Russian fertilizer producer Uralkali. Sotheby's agreed last week to be acquired by French-Israeli telecommunications magnate Patrick Drahi for $3.7 billion. The case is Accent Delight International Ltd et al v Sotheby's et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-09011.

Ex-GOP Rep: I 'See a Shooter' When I Look at Kyle Kashuv's Racist Posts,"Reacting to Harvard's decision to pull Parkland shooting survivor and right-wing pundit Kyle Kashuv's admission over past racial slurs, former Republican Rep. David Jolly asserted Tuesday that the racist messages Kashuv sent to classmates were the hallmarks of a mass shooter. During an MSNBC panel discussion on Kashuv, host Stephanie Ruhle asked Jolly currently an MSNBC analyst if he thought the Ivy League university's decision was political, noting that prominent conservatives have ""cried foul"" because Kashuv was one of the few Parkland survivors who vocally defended gun rights. ""I don't,"" Jolly replied. ""I think this is the perfect story for our time. Within our culture, leaders are given greater permission to racist statements and people with racist feelings. They are given greater equity. It is important for Harvard to say, 'Not in our community.'"" Referencing messages Kashuv sent in which he repeatedly used the n-word, Jolly spotlighted one post in which the teenager seemingly referenced shooting up his high school to speculate that Kashuv could have been a potential shooter himself. ""And he referred to one of the shoot-'em-up video games and said they should put a map of that on his high school,"" Jolly exclaimed. And this was two years before Parkland. And my immediate reaction when I really dug into this, these are the social media postings we see of a shooter and we ask, 'Where were the signs?'"" The former Florida congressman added: ""See something, say something. We see a shooter and then we go back and look at social media posts and this is exactly what we see. I understand the sensitivity of this man because of Parkland. I'm not a mental health professional to assess him on those grounds.: Ruhle, meanwhile, pushed back, asking Jolly if that speculation was ""too far."" ""It is not,"" Jolly responded. ""No, it is not, Stephanie."" He went on to ponder what would happen if an ""incident were to occur,"" noting that Kashuv has gained audiences with the president and other high-profile conservatives over his push for stronger gun rights. ""You have to question how do we promote somebody with these social media posts in their background?"" Jolly asked. ""The young man deserves redemption. But he also deserves a closer look to whether someone with this profile should be able to purchase a firearm under the gun laws of the United States."" Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

Hong Kong has been devoured by a 'sea of black' amid protests over extradition plans with China: How the intense blowback inspired a historic apology,"The extradition plan was tabled Saturday, and Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued an apology Sunday admitting ""deficiencies"" in government process. Hong Kong has been engulfed in protests the past week over a proposed law that would allow extradition of residents to mainland China. The bill prompted widespread anger and stoked fears that the new rules could be exploited to quash dissidents and political dissent. Demonstrations have at times blanketed the Asian financial center in a ""sea of black,"" and protesters are calling for government leaders to resign. The extradition plan was tabled Saturday, and Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued a mea culpa Sunday admitting ""deficiencies"" in the government's process. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . After drawing fierce backlash and some of the largest protests in Hong Kong's history, extradition plans between the territory and China have been put on ice and chief executive Carrie Lam has issued a mea culpa as leaders try to quell a growing political crisis. Widescale demonstrations that at times have blanketed the Asian financial center in a ""sea of black"" broke out last Sunday over a proposed law that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China, stoking fears that the new rules could be exploited to quash dissidents and political dissent. Protests continued throughout the week, and hundreds of thousands of black-clad residents continued to swarm the streets this Sunday to call for government leaders to step down, even after the bill was indefinitely tabled on Saturday. Amid the intense blowback in the territory, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 after more than 150 years under British authority, Lam issued a statement Sunday admitting ""deficiencies"" in the government's process and saying there was no timetable for revisiting the policy. ""The Chief Executive admitted that the deficiencies in the Government's work had led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people,"" the statement read. ""The Chief Executive apologised to the people of Hong Kong for this and pledged to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public.""

Protests erupted in Hong Kong a week ago amid efforts to pass an extradition bill allowing some suspects to be sent to China to stand trial. The proposed law was deeply unpopular, as many believe it could be wielded as a tool to weed out and silence political dissidents. Hundreds of thousands of residents of the territory swarmed the streets to express their opposition to the bill. The marchers are demanding that Chief Executive Carrie Lam resign. Stand-offs between demonstrators and authorities have gotten ugly at times, with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowds. More than 70 people have been injured. One protestor died after falling from scaffolding in an attempt to hang a banner. That prompted mourners to lay out flowers and other makeshift memorials. Lam said at a press conference Saturday that she was suspending the extradition bill. That did little to subdue the protests. Black-clad demonstrators continued to hit the streets in full force on Sunday to renew calls for government leaders to step down. That created a ""sea of black"" that has cloaked the streets of the Asian financial hub.

"saudi arabia's mbs is center stage at g-20, only nine months after khashoggi killing","Amid international outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia's ongoing military campaign in Yemen last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was positioned at the very edge of the traditional ""family photo"" of world leaders at the G-20 summit last November. Looking every bit a pariah, Mohammed walked away alone after the group photo was taken as other leaders of the world's wealthiest nations mingled   while protesters outside the venue demanded his arrest. Only half a year later, however, the crown prince is no longer isolated at the G-20. In the photograph of world leaders taken on Friday at this year's event in Osaka, Mohammed was front and center   standing between President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the event's host. For his supporters, it is yet another sign that Mohammed survived the questions over his mercurial de facto rule of the kingdom and has been welcomed back by the global political establishment with open arms. ""Clearly he has retained a lot of his stature,"" said Ali Shihabi, the founder of the pro-Riyadh Arabia Foundation in Washington, noting that the crown prince had been well received by the leaders of India, China, Japan and South Korea in the last six months. ""If anything, his high visibility at G-20 is only enhancing"" his reputation, Shihabi said. ""His robes also help."" The crown prince's traditional attire may not be the only thing that made him more visible in this year's photograph. Official protocol dictates where world leaders stand in the family photo, with the general rules being that heads of state, rather than heads of government or international organizations, are at the front and those who've spent more time in office closer toward the center. Though Mohammed is not technically a head of state yet and is less senior than some others, Saudi Arabia is also scheduled to host next year's G-20 summit, which will begin on Nov. 21 in Riyadh. David Miliband, former British foreign secretary and current chief executive of the humanitarian organization International Rescue Committee, said that the largely warm welcome of Mohammed and other supposed pariahs like Russia's Vladimir Putin at this year's G-20 reflected an age of impunity in global politics. ""All those countries that have a relationship with Saudi Arabia need to use those relationships in a way that curbs the failed war strategy in Yemen,"" Miliband said of the Riyadh G-20. Mohammed, 33, had initially been celebrated on the world stage for spearheading an ambitious domestic reform strategy that sought to not only remake Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent economy but also loosen conservative religious social conventions. But the crown prince's role in launching Saudi Arabia's conflict in Yemen, which came as Riyadh took aggressive positions against Qatar and Iran, called into doubt the wisdom of his foreign policy. The killing of Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul in October reinforced the notion that his government cared little about human rights and drew a global backlash. Last year, some world leaders had avoided the young Saudi royal, while others had criticized him to his face. An overheard conversation between Mohammed and Emmanuel Macron suggested that the French president was privately upset with him. ""You never listen to me,"" Macron said.But other world leaders still greeted him enthusiastically. Russia's Putin laughed as he slapped hands with Mohammed as they met   an image that Miliband said epitomized the ""new arrogance of power"" among those who act with perceived impunity.

Expanding roles keeping Catchings busy in post-retirement,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP)   Tamika Catchings still follows the old routine. She works out in the morning, visits her favorite spot for a relaxing cup of tea then heads to Bankers Life Fieldhouse where she is still chasing WNBA dreams. Yes, nearly three years since Catchings played her final basketball game, the 39-year-old former star is establishing herself in a variety of new roles: Business owner and front-office executive, not to mention being a contestant on NBC's popular ""American Ninja Warrior."" ""I never thought I'd have my own tea shop or be an entrepreneur,"" said Catchings, the Indiana Fever's vice president of basketball operations. ""It's like its own little community, like our own oasis in the middle of Indianapolis and your worries are left outside. I love what I've been able to create here."" It's clear the people of Indianapolis also enjoy mingling with one of the most endearing and inspiring players in league history. On any given morning, the four-time Olympic gold medalist can be found chatting with customers at Tea's Me Cafe. Here, they embrace Catchings' warm personality, typified by a sign reading ""Give every day an opportunity to become the best day of your life."" Those who have spent much time around Catchings know that is her vision for life. Now, though, she's spreading the new message to people like 16-year-old employee Jordan Kimbrough, who until a year ago knew Catchings only as a prominent athlete. ""She comes in whenever she can and talks to everyone and the first thing she does is give them a hug,"" Kimbrough said. ""A lot of people think she's a celebrity but she treats everyone the same. She's always happy, always smiles."" And, in Kimbrough's opinion, a great boss to boot. The personal connection has been one of Catchings' traits during a career that included 10 All-Star appearances and five WNBA defensive player of the year awards. Talk to almost anyone in Knoxville, Tennessee, or Indianapolis, where she spent her college and pro careers, and the players and coaches there eagerly recount stories about how Catchings made them feel special. Despite her incredible successes   1998 NCAA champion, 2012 WNBA champion and finals MVP, 2011 league MVP, along with winning titles in Turkey and Poland   Catchings believed her greatest achievements came off the court. She started the Catch The Stars Foundation, a charity that keeps her busy traveling the country in between all the other new gigs. She serves as co-chair of Indianapolis' organizing committee for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, and in March she accepted the vice president's position that allows her to coordinate the Fever's day to day operations with coach Pokey Chatman. ""I think my biggest strength is understanding players, being able to understand when enough is enough,"" Catchings said. ""I talk to the players, one-on-one about not just the game but what's going on in their lives."" Whatever she's doing seems to be working. After Indiana's streak of 12 consecutive playoff berths ended in 2017, the year after Catchings walked away, the Fever finished last season with a league-worst 6-28 mark. This year, Indiana posted five wins in its first 10 games just as Catchings gets ready to come out of retirement for a cameo appearance on ""America Ninja Warrior."" In April, she announced she planned to try out for the show and started posting videos of her workouts at Train Yard 317 in Indianapolis. The recorded episode will appear July 1; Catchings can't say how it turned out. ""It's totally different because the biggest thing with 'American Ninja Warrior' is upper body strength and in basketball, you want to be light on your feet,"" she said. ""So being able to get the fingers strong enough to hold your whole body up is a real challenge and keeps you going."" Especially with her playing days over. ""I don't think I ever dreamed I would be where I am right now,"" she said. ""But I love working for the organization, I love the foundation and I love that I've got the tea shop. I've got everything I want.""",health,AP News,center
"Colorado school officials ask voters to consider tearing down, rebuilding Columbine High School","It was the place that spawned a new breed of attacks on innocent people. Now, 20 years later , Columbine High School faces scrutiny of another kind: Whether it should be torn down and replaced. Calling the infamous Colorado shooting ""a macabre source of inspiration"" for troubled people around the globe, the superintendent of the school system overseeing the high school said in a letter posted Thursday that it might be time to consider a change. Jefferson Public Schools Superintendent Jason E. Glass said in the letter, sent to the Columbine community, that the idea is in the very early stages and may not happen. It would entail asking voters to approve $70 million ""at some point"" to construct a new school. He encouraged people to keep an open mind to possibly razing and replacing the school's buildings. Thirteen people were slain by two students in the April 20, 1999, massacre. 'We're not protecting our children': Santa Fe shooting survivors demand answers, independent review ""Since that time, school shootings have become all-too-familiar in our nation,"" Glass wrote. ""From the horrors of the six and seven year olds taken at Sandy Hook, to last year's shooting at Marjory Stoneman-Douglas High School, to the recent Douglas County STEM shooting in our neighboring community   while still rare, school shootings are growing in frequency."" He said Columbine, in Littleton, Colorado, ""serves as a point of origin for this contagion of school shootings"" and has bred obsessive behavior around the globe. Glass mentioned the case earlier this year of Sol Pais, a Florida teen who killed herself in Colorado after making a threat and causing schools across the Denver metro area to close. ""Columbine High School has a gravitational-pull for these sorts of individuals,"" Glass wrote. ""Annually, local law enforcement and Jeffco's Department of School Safety make contacts with hundreds of individuals seeking to enter the school and reconnect with the 1999 murders. Most of them are there to satisfy curiosity or a macabre, but harmless interest in the school. For a small group of others, there is a potential intent to do harm."" That interest has been increasing. The letter says the number of people trying to enter the school illegally has been increasing to record levels, perhaps fueled by the 20th anniversary of the shooting. Opinion: Columbine tragedy 20 years later: Despite fears, risk of dying in school shooting is low The Jeffco school board proposal is exploring the possibility of asking voters for between $60 and $70 million to build a new high school, which would keep the Columbine High School name. It would also keep the same school colors and mascot, but would be built with enhanced safety features. ""We are in the very preliminary and exploratory stages of these conversations and we are seeking community feedback and thoughts on this proposal,"" Glass wrote.

Trump's Justice Department says it helped Manafort stay off Rikers Island out of respect for his 'unique' health needs,"Paul Manafort still has friends in high places. The nation's second highest-ranking law enforcement official stepped in last week and made sure President Trump's former campaign boss was spared an uncomfortable stay on Rikers Island, according to the Justice Department. The extraordinary intervention from Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen came in response to a letter Manafort lawyer Todd Blanche sent to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on May 17, requesting that his client be allowed to remain in federal custody as he faces state fraud charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. Blanche said in the letter that Manafort, 70, suffers from unspecified ""health challenges"" and that Rikers Island is ""unsecure, unsanitary and dangerous."" Acting on Blanche's request, Rosen sent a letter to Vance on June 11, asking if he had any objections to Manafort remaining in a federal lockup as opposed to being transferred to Rikers Island, a senior Justice Department official told the Daily News on Tuesday. Vance did not protest, the official said. ""In light of New York's position, and Mr. Manafort's unique health and safety needs, the department determined to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in federal custody during the pendency of his state proceedings,"" the official said. ""This arrangement will not have any impact on his state proceedings."" Manafort is currently serving a seven and a half year sentence for his federal conviction on a slew of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Shortly after Manafort's federal case wrapped up in March, Vance's office indicted him on state mortgage fraud charges   a move meant in part as a firewall to make sure the disgraced Republican politico faces justice even in the event that he's pardoned by President Trump, according to sources. Manafort was transferred to the federally-administrated Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan on Monday morning in advance of being arraigned on Vance's charges. Most felons in Manafort's position would be transferred to Rikers Island, and Rosen's intervention may be unprecedented, according to legal experts. ""Calling this highly unusual doesn't even begin to capture how strange it is for the no. 2 official at DOJ to intervene in a state custody issue,"" tweeted Joyce Vance, the former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Trump nominated Rosen to his current post in February after Rod Rosenstein resigned. Rosen serves as Attorney General William Barr's right-hand man. In a June 14 response letter to Rosen, Vance's office laid into Blanche for going behind its back in reaching out to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which falls under the purview of the Justice Department. Vance's office said Manafort had agreed in March to waive ""any right to challenge"" the way he was brought to New York and suggested Blanche's letter to the Justice Department flew in the face of that deal. ""By submitting the Blanche Letter in opposition to our request for temporary custody, Mr. Manafort has violated the terms of our agreement,"" the DA wrote. Blanche declined to comment on Tuesday.     ©2019 New York Daily News Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",legal arguments,New York Daily News,left
donald trump jr. to be interviewed by senate intelligence committee behind closed doors wednesday,"Donald Trump Jr. is returning to the Senate Intelligence Committee to be interviewed behind closed doors on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. The appearance of the President's eldest son Wednesday comes after a lengthy and contentious fight that spilled into public view after the committee issued a subpoena to Trump Jr. and he initially balked at testifying for a second time. Trump Jr.'s allies mounted an aggressive campaign targeting Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr for the subpoena, accusing the North Carolina Republican of helping the Democrats by continuing his committee's investigation even after special counsel Robert Mueller had wrapped up his probe. Many of those criticizing Burr included his own Senate Republican colleagues. But Burr did not back down from the subpoena, and the committee and Trump Jr. struck a deal for him to testify for two-to-four hours on roughly a half dozen topics, including the key questions the committee has for the President's eldest son about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the Trump Tower Moscow project. While the committee struck an agreement with Trump Jr. for his appearance, the committee's subpoena is still in effect and he's still coming before the committee under subpoena, according to a source familiar with the matter. Burr declined to comment Tuesday about Trump Jr.'s appearance to CNN. The Senate Intelligence Committee is now two years into its investigation into Russian election meddling in 2016. Burr has said the committee is nearly done with its bipartisan probe, but still has a handful of witnesses it needs to hear from. Trump Jr. initially testified before the panel in 2017 , but the committee has brought back several witnesses for follow-up questions, including President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former lawyer Michael Cohen. The committee began engaging Trump Jr. to return to the committee in December, and he initially agreed to testify voluntarily twice before postponing, leading to the panel's subpoena issued in April. Burr has been praised by his Democratic colleagues for keeping the investigation on a bipartisan track while other congressional probes were plagued by partisan fighting. And he was praised the President for stating his committee had not found any evidence of collusion. But Trump questioned Burr's move to subpoena his son after news of it broke last month, calling it ""very unfair"" and retweeting on Twitter articles attacking Burr. The committee is interested in hearing again from Trump Jr. because of discrepancies between his testimony in 2017 and what other witnesses have told both the committee and the special counsel's office. Trump Jr. appeared before the Senate Intelligence, Senate Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees in 2017, and the release of the Mueller report prompted a new round questions about what Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary panel, which released a transcript of his interview. Trump Jr. testified he only told Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort ahead of time about the Trump Tower meeting in which a Russian attorney promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. But then-campaign deputy Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty in the special counsel probe, told Mueller that Trump Jr. talked about a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation at a campaign meeting in the days before the Trump Tower meeting. Trump Jr.'s testimony on the Trump Tower Moscow project has also been scrutinized, in which he said he was ""peripherally aware"" of the project. But Mueller's report says Cohen testified he discussed the project on multiple occasions with Trump Jr. and that the discussions were not just ""idle chit chat.""

A man knocked on the firehouse's door just before midnight on Sunday and surrendered the little girl , estimated to be 18 to 24 months old, Leisey said. The man said he had been given the child by a woman who claimed to be her mother, and that he was giving the girl to firefighters for safekeeping, Leisey said. ""I couldn't really figure out how well she spoke. So, she didn't really respond well to reading or anything,"" Leisey said. ""But, the universal language of Sesame Street did the trick. So, we sat in the day room and rocked to Sesame Street until she fell asleep."" For more than 24 hours, no one came forward for the child or reported her missing. The toddler is now safe and with child protective services. Sacramento police said Tuesday that investigators have a good lead on who might be the girl's mother . ""We have been in contact with the female half and we are working with her,"" police spokesperson Marcus Basquez said. He said investigators are working to determine if the woman who reached out to the department is the little girl's mother, adding ""nothing's confirmed."" ""Our detectives will be working diligently on this investigation,"" Basquez said. So far, there are no charges pending against anyone in this case. Under California's Safe Surrender law, newborns less than 72 hours old can be dropped off at fire stations with no criminal penalties -- and no questions asked. That law does not pertain to toddlers, and it's highly unusual for a toddler to be surrendered. ""I have not had a toddler dropped off at the firehouse while I've been on duty,"" Sacramento Fire Capt. Keith Wade said. Wade said he's never experienced a situation like this in his 19 years of service with the Sacramento Fire Department. He said it's important for people to know that firehouses are safe places for anyone in crisis. ""We want the public to know, we're not just there for emergencies -- but we're also there for answers,"" Wade said. ""If they don't have anywhere to go and they're not sure what to do, the Sacramento Fire Department and all of our stations -- our doors are open to anyone that needs some sort of answer for something."" The crisis nursery at the Sacramento Children's Home also provides help for parents in stressful situations. The nursery serves as an overnight shelter for children, between birth and 5 years old, from families in crisis at home. Leisey said he's happy the child is now safe, but it's not the first time he's rescued a toddler. ""Prior to my career in the fire service, I found a kid who fell in a mall fountain pool, "" Leisey explained. He added that he ""picked him up and drug him around looking for his mom until I found her.""

BuzzFeed Journalists Protest in Push for Union Recognition,"(Bloomberg) -- Citing mismanagement, pay disparities and job cuts, BuzzFeed News employees walked off the job on Monday afternoon in the hopes of getting the online-media company to voluntarily recognize their union. Employees in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco are taking part in the protests, according to the NewsGuild of New York. Plans for the walkout were first reported by Bloomberg News. Video of the walkout showed BuzzFeed employees standing outside the company's New York office chanting and carrying signs that said ""Recognize the BuzzFeed Union!!"" There was also a giant inflatable rat -- a common form of protest by striking trade unions. The staffers are taking a page from employees at Vox Media, who staged a walkout earlier this month and soon clinched their first labor agreement. Despite four months of negotiations, BuzzFeed News employees and management still can't agree on which workers are eligible to be part of the new bargaining unit -- a question that unions and companies frequently spar over. ""Throughout the process, BuzzFeed has attempted to exclude workers they claim are managerial, supervisory or confidential despite the fact that these journalists neither manage employees nor are privy to confidential information,"" according to the statement. Job Cuts BuzzFeed News staffers agreed to unionize in February, saying they would seek better benefits and fair pay after seeing some colleagues lose their jobs the prior month. Since then, they've been calling on BuzzFeed's management to recognize their union. ""We have legitimate grievances about unfair pay disparities, mismanaged pivots and layoffs, weak benefits, skyrocketing health insurance costs, diversity, and more,"" the BuzzFeed News Organizing Committee said in a statement. In a note to staff Monday, BuzzFeed Chief Executive Officer Jonah Peretti said the company's journalists refused to accept an offer on June 4 and are ""seeking to impose additional demands that threaten our progress around voluntary recognition."" He said the company needed a way to identify employees who are included and excluded from the bargaining unit. ""Our proposal is both responsive to our employees' requests, and mindful of the way the company operates,"" Peretti said. In January, BuzzFeed eliminated 15% of its headcount, part of a wave of layoffs at media outlets this year. Publishers like BuzzFeed, once the darlings of the media industry, have struggled to find profitable business models. The tumult has led journalists at several media outlets to opt for collective bargaining. While that hasn't prevented layoffs, it has in some cases cushioned the blow. For instance, agreements can help ensure that workers who lose their jobs get severance pay. Hundreds of Vox Media employees walked off the job earlier this month. A day later, they reached a tentative labor agreement. The union contract includes minimum salary guarantees and four months of paid parental leave, among other things.

The 5 best features coming to Apple Maps in iOS 13,"Apple Maps is getting a major update with iOS 13. Here's a look at our favorite features so far after using the public beta. Apple Maps is getting a major overhaul in iOS 13 that brings a new redesigned map and other features. It'll be easier to get directions to favorite places at a glance, and Apple is adding its own answer to Google's Street View, among other additions. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Apple Maps has long played second fiddle to Google Maps, but the company is trying to change that in a big way with iOS 13. The new software update will bring a variety of new features to Apple Maps when it launches later this year, such as a redesigned map that includes much more detail than the current one, the ability to build collections of favorite places, and a new Street View-like perspective. Read more: Apple's new iPhone update could solve one of the biggest annoyances about video chatting Apple Maps is just one of the several iPhone apps getting an upgrade with iOS 13. The company is also overhauling its Reminders app and implementing new features into its Photos app, among others. Here's a look at some of the best features coming to Apple Maps this fall based on my experience using the recently launched public beta. Look Around Apple's answer to Google Street View is limited in its current capacity, but useful nonetheless. Based on the areas that currently support Look Around in the beta, it seems like Apple Maps will offer high-resolution imagery with navigation controls that feel even smoother than Google's. When trying out the feature while looking around the area near the Civic Center in San Francisco, I was impressed by how easy it was to jump between locations with Look Around, even if I wasn't following a straight path. I could, for example, hop over to a block running perpendicular to the street I'm currently viewing with just a single tap. The movements also look more seamless and fluid in Look Around than in Street View. Better transit information Transit directions in the new version of Apple Maps will be more robust and detailed in iOS 13. Instead of just pulling up the closest options and providing a general time window for departures, the new Maps is much more specific. It will tell you the exact number of minutes until the next train departs and updates in real time to show delays. It's a small addition, but one that could make Apple's navigation app a more fit Google Maps alternative. Easier access to frequently visited places In iOS 13, it will be easier to quickly get directions to frequently visited places in Apple Maps. The app will pin the places you've labeled as favorites to the home screen, making it easy to tap right into a destination as soon as you launch the app. That's a big departure from the current version of Apple Maps, which just displays destinations like your job and recently searched places upon opening the app. If you pull up to view the entire information card, you'll also see your collections and places you've viewed recently. It's a much richer set of information at a glance than what the current iteration of Maps offers. Dark Mode iOS 13 introduces a new system-wide Dark Mode that will be available for all of Apple's first-party apps, including Maps. And while it's only a cosmetic benefit, it's still a slick aesthetic that makes certain aspects of the map pop more than usual, such as public transit lines. Collections of favorite places Apple wants to make it easier to keep track of your favorite places. With the updated app, you'll be able to build lists around certain themes and locations so that you can quickly find your favorite bars, restaurants, and other points of interest. These lists will be available on the home screen in Apple Maps underneath your favorites and Siri-suggested destinations.",science,Business Insider,center
Kamala Harris introduces bill to cover HIV prevention drug,"WASHINGTON   Sen. Kamala Harris introduced legislation Thursday that would require health insurance companies to cover the HIV prevention drug PrEP, a first-of-its-kind bill that the California Democrat timed to coincide with Pride Month. The bill would require that insurance plans cover the full cost of PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as require initial tests and related follow-up visits with a doctor. That would go beyond a recommendation this month by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of government-appointed prevention experts, that PrEP be given to people at high risk of contracting HIV. The medicine, sold under the brand name Truvada, can reduce the risk of contracting HIV by up to 99% if taken every day, according to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. Promotion of its use in San Francisco has helped the city bring new cases of HIV to record lows . For people without health insurance or those whose policies don't cover the drug, out-of-pocket costs for PrEP can be as high as $13,000 a year, the AIDS foundation says. Use of PrEP has particularly lagged among Americans of color. Besides requiring health insurance providers to pay for the drug, Harris' bill would set up a grant program for states to help people without insurance get PrEP. It would also prohibit life and long-term-care insurance providers from denying certain forms of coverage or charging more to people who take the drug. ""PrEP is a critical advancement in the fight against HIV that can finally provide peace of mind to Americans who live in the shadow of the HIV epidemic,"" Harris said. ""But for too many in our country, lack of insurance coverage and exorbitant costs have put PrEP out of reach   and that needs to change."" Lawmakers have introduced bills this year to fund grant programs for PrEP. But none of the bills has sought to ensure its coverage without cost to patients, and none has advanced. Harris' bill will face long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate. In California, state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, has proposed a bill that would provide people their first 30 days of PrEP over the counter if they receive counseling and an HIV test first. The bill passed the state Senate and is pending in the Assembly. Tal Kopan is The San Francisco Chronicle's Washington correspondent.

35 Chihuahuas found in Phoenix home during attempted eviction,"More than 35 Chihuahuas were found in an apparently abandoned house in Phoenix after Maricopa County constables went to the house with an eviction order Thursday morning. Arcadia-Bitmore Constable Carolyn Lane responded to the house near 46th Street and McDowell Road after the new owner filed an eviction complaint and summons on May 29 because the previous occupant had not taken the dogs. Lane said she found the Chihuahuas in deplorable conditions. ""There's a lot of feces in the property,"" Lane said. ""I wouldn't think it would be healthy for the dogs."" Inside the house, Lane and another constable found the dogs' food in an unopened, 50-pound bag on the counter. The dogs could not access the food, according to Lane. There was only one A/C unit in a back bedroom. Phoenix reached a high of 106 degrees, and the area was under an excessive heat warning. The Chihuahuas had access to the backyard through a doggie door, where they had a big tub of drinking water. Lane also noticed some of them get in the water, using it as a pool. Lane, concerned for the health of the dogs, contacted the Arizona Humane Society, which arrived at the house around 4 p.m. to evaluate their conditions and see if they should be removed from the house. According to Lane, the dogs were found to be healthy by the Humane Society, including some of the older dogs. ""If the situation does become dangerous with the A/C going out they will probably take the dogs,"" Lane said. Because the dogs are healthy, the Humane Society must wait 72 hours for the owner to respond to their notice, which was posted next to the door. ""Animals are personal property,"" Lane said. ""You can't just take them. You have to try and reach the owners and have them come get them. That's the process. After 72 hours (the Humane Society) can take them."" The Humane Society will return to the house every day to check on the dogs, she added. For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com . Neighbors don't mind furry occupants When outside, the dogs can be seen through a gate, where they bark at anyone they see. ""I don't find them to be a big nuisance,"" said William Sherry, who lives next door. ""They make noise. They're dogs."" Sherry has lived in his house more than seven years, and he said he spoke to his neighbor every once in a while, describing him as pleasant. Sherry was not surprised to hear that there were so many dogs in the house next door. ""I knew there was an awful lot, they're all over the place. They're hard to count,"" Sherry said. Sherry mostly saw them behind the fence, which is only feet from the wall of his house. On occasion, he saw one or two in the driveway. He never saw his neighbor walk the dogs. To Sherry, the dogs did not appear sick, injured or malnourished, but he did sometimes see them nursing, as if they had puppies recently. He questioned how they were getting enough care and attention. ""I don't know how he can take care of 30 dogs,"" Sherry said.

key moments from jay inslee's 2020 presidential debate appearance,"SEATTLE, WA   The field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates is packed, and so was the stage at the first debate held in Miami Wednesday evening. Gov. Jay Inslee stood among nine other candidates   including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, and NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio   in his first shot at national notoriety. As most in Washington (and now the nation) know, Inslee, 68, is the climate candidate. Ahead of the debate, he released the ""Evergreen Economy Plan,"" a $9 trillion package that would, among other things, create high-paying green economy jobs. Counter to coal-loving President Donald Trump, Inslee has also proposed shutting down all coal plants in the U.S. by 2030. As important as it is, climate will likely not be the main issue in the 2020 presidential election   the Democratic National Committee has even declined to do a debate solely on climate. On Wednesday, the candidates fielded questions on everything from federal immigration code to Iran. So how did Inslee do on his signature issue and on other topics? Here's a recap of his debate performance. Inslee's intro Inslee walked out between Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Maryland U.S. Rep. John Delaney. As we know, Inslee is tall, but Beto O'Rourke appeared to be just a hair taller, and O'Rourke had the advantage of being positioned in center stage. Appropriately, Inslee was wearing a blue suit and greenish tie, the same colors as his presidential campaign logo. First chance to talk Inslee was the ninth candidate called on to speak (not counting followup questions), and he had a good moment. Inslee followed Delaney on a question about jobs and the economy. He seized the opportunity to mention that unions are the best way to create new jobs and higher wages   and that got him a round of applause. ""It's not right the CEO of McDonald's makes 2,000, 100 times the people slinging hash,"" he said. (In 2017, the McDonald's CEO actually made 3,101 times the median McDonald's worker .) Then Inslee pivoted to climate, saying that he'll put people to work fixing the environment. ""Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer, we know they cause jobs,"" Inslee said. No 'Medicare for all' All the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would give up their current healthcare plan for a government plan   a reference to talk of a single-payer Medicare-for-all system. Inslee did not raise his hand. In the ensuing debate, a heated one, Inslee kept raising his hand to speak. When he was finally called on, he highlighted that he got a public option passed in Washington. He also waded into abortion, and kind of got slapped for it. He remarked he's ""the only candidate"" to pass a law that protects abortion access. ""There are three women up here who have fought for a woman's right to choose,"" Klobuchar retorted, referring to herself, Warren, and Gabbard. Border crisis When the topic came around, Inslee was the last candidate to called on to talk about the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. He was specifically asked what he would do on ""day one"" as president, but didn't really answer. ""There's no reason for the detention and separation of these children, they should be released pending their hearings,"" he responded. He also took an opportunity to knock Trump. ""Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me that he would try to send refugees to Washington state. I told him that's not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state,"" he said.",environmental issues,San Francisco Chronicle,left
N Carolina man pleads guilty to killing 3 Muslim students,"DURHAM, N.C.   The North Carolina man charged with killing three much-admired Muslim university students pleaded guilty Wednesday, four years after the slayings. Craig Stephen Hicks, 50, entered the plea to three counts of first-degree murder in a Durham courtroom packed with dozens of the victims' family and friends. It came two months after the new district attorney dropped plans to seek the death penalty in hopes of concluding a case that she said had languished too long. ""I've wanted to plead guilty since day one,"" Hicks told Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson. The judge said Hicks had agreed as part of his plea bargain to accept three consecutive life sentences without parole. Police say that in February 2015, Hicks burst into a condo in Chapel Hill owned by 23-year-old Deah Barakat and fatally shot Barakat, his wife, Yusor Abu-Salha, 21; and her 19-year-old sister Razan Abu-Salha. At the time of the slayings, Barakat, a dental student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and Yusor Abu-Salha had been married for less than two months, and she had just been accepted to the dental school. Razan had just made the dean's list in her first semester at North Carolina State University. All three were making plans to visit Turkey during their coming summer break to volunteer in a dental clinic at a camp for Syrian war refugees. Barakat was shot several times as he stood in his doorway, autopsy results showed. His wife and her sister were shot in the head at close range inside the condo. On Wednesday, Hicks listened attentively as the prosecutor, Kendra Montgomery-Blinn, described him as a man who was watching the American Dream slip away while the victims were pursuing it. She said Hicks' third marriage was disintegrating and he'd recently quit his job in anger after workers described him as constantly playing computer sniper games. ""The defendant was an angry and bitter man,"" Montgomery-Blinn said. At the time of the shootings, Chapel Hill police said Hicks claimed he was provoked by competition over parking spaces at the condo complex. Relatives of the victims said they believed the shootings were a hate crime. The slain women's father, psychiatrist Mohammad Abu-Salha, testified to a congressional hearing on hate crimes in April that Hicks had expressed hateful comments about his daughters wearing head scarves in observance of their faith. ""Three beautiful young Americans were brutally murdered and there is no question in our minds that this tragedy was born of bigotry and hate,"" Dr. Abu-Salha testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. ___ Follow Emery P.

Google knows everywhere you go   here's how to stop it from tracking you and delete the logs,"Google keeps a log of everywhere you go if you use Google apps and services on your phone. It has a creepy level of detail that might surprise you. Google makes it easy to find this information and limit how it can track you, though, so here's how to do that. Google knows a lot about you and, if you use Google Maps or other Google apps, it stores a copy of everywhere you go. I recently performed Google's ""Privacy Checkup"" to learn a bit more about what it knows about me, and was pretty surprised at the level of detail it had on my exact locations. I picked a random date: April 16, 2019. It knew everywhere I went, including that I took Route 95 to our office in northern New Jersey and that I arrived at 7:58 a.m. It knew that at 1:02 p.m. I drove to Jersey City and took a train in to Manhattan to the New York Stock Exchange before returning home at 4:38 p.m. And it has a copy of the pictures I took at each location. It's a creepy level of detail. Google says that it uses location history to ""create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices even when you aren't using a specific Google service"" and that the ""map is only visible to you."" The data, it says, provides ""improved map searches and commute routes, as well as helping you to rediscover the places you've been and the routes you've traveled."" I don't really care about that information. I know the roads I drove on April 16, and I can't see any reason why Google should store it, even if it's only for my use.

SF moves toward ending chronic homelessness among military veterans,"San Francisco came a big step closer to ending chronic homelessness for veterans Wednesday with the opening of a 70-unit supportive housing complex for people who have served in the military. The complex is in the refurbished Auburn Hotel on Minna Street, near Sixth Street, and it brings to 300 the number of residential rooms or apartments opened in the past year in San Francisco for homeless veterans. Filling these rooms means there are now fewer than 150 chronically homeless vets   meaning the most troubled, on the streets for at least a year   left living outside in San Francisco, according to Jeff Kositsky, head of the city Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. Kositsky said the city hopes to all but eliminate chronic homelessness among veterans in 2018. In addition to getting the remaining chronically homeless vets off the streets, that will mean finding shelter for the estimated 17 additional veterans who fall into that category each month in the city. Officials try to deal with the problem by opening residential buildings like the Auburn, handing out rent vouchers and giving people bus tickets home if there are people waiting for them there. ""It's been a challenge, but we're still committed to getting there,"" Kositsky said. He noted that in 2014, there were 350 chronically homeless veterans in San Francisco, and since then more than 900 have been housed. Acting Mayor London Breed said at the Auburn that ""we are well on our way"" to ending chronic homelessness among veterans. She called the new complex ""the least we can do for people who put their lives on the line time and time again."" The Auburn is being leased by the city and managed by the nonprofit Delivering Innovation in Supportive Housing. Episcopal Community Services, another nonprofit, will provide counseling services on site   a key component of the ""supportive"" part of supportive housing.

A US ally is furious and demanding answers from China after a 'hit and run' in the South China Sea,"The Philippines is furiously demanding answers after an alleged ""hit-and-run"" incident in the South China Sea. The island nation claims that a Chinese fishing vessel rammed a Philippine ship, sank it, and then abandoned 22 Filipino fishermen in open water to drown. All the sailors were ultimately rescued by another ship nearby. The Philippines sent a formal diplomatic protest to Beijing Thursday condemning the actions of the Chinese ship and urging China to investigate the matter. Visit Business Insider's home page for more stories. The Philippines is taking China to task over an alleged ""hit-and-run"" incident in which a Chinese fishing ship fled the scene after it slammed into an anchored Philippine vessel in the South China Sea, sinking it and abandoning 22 Filipino fishermen in open waters to drown. The troubling incident occurred this week near Reed Bank in the Spratly Islands, an area in the disputed South China Sea where Chinese naval and maritime militia forces have been increasingly active and, at times, forceful when enforcing its sovereignty claims. The crew of the sunken Philippine vessel was ultimately rescued by a Vietnamese ship operating nearby. Read more: Vietnam claims a Chinese ship rammed and sank a fishing boat in the latest South China Sea clash The Philippines sent a formal diplomatic protest to Beijing Thursday in response to the ""hit-and-run"" incident. Teodoro Locsin, the secretary of foreign affairs for the Philippines, characterized the abandonment of the Philippine crew in violation of maritime norms as ""contemptible and condemnable,"" local media ABS-CBN reported . Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana accused the Chinese ship of intentionally ramming the Philippine vessel, FB Gimber1. Other defense officials have suggested the collision may have been an accident. The incident is currently under investigation. President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, who has sought closer ties to Beijing while at times sharply criticizing Washington, was ""outraged"" in the aftermath of the incident, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said, according to the South China Morning Post. ""We will not allow ourselves to be assaulted, to be bullied, to be the subject of such barbaric, uncivilized and outrageous actions,"" he explained at a press briefing Thursday. ""Whether it's a form of bullying or not, it's outrageous, it's barbaric, it's uncivilized, and we're condemning it."" The spokesman said that if the incident was intentional, it will be considered an ""act of aggression."" Panelo added that the Philippines would consider cutting diplomatic ties with China. There are, however, potentially broader implications should the situation escalate. Earlier this year, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson informed China that its paramilitary maritime militia could be considered a combatant force, and in March, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised that ""any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea will trigger mutual defense obligations."" The US has also been involved in confrontations in the Spratly Islands, where the Philippines accused China of sending hundreds of ships to swarm a Philippine-controlled territory a few months ago.

"Bridge defendant freed, another spared prison pending appeal","TRENTON, N.J. (AP)   A former Chris Christie appointee who was convicted in the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal has been freed from prison and a former Christie aide won't have to report for her sentence while a U.S. Supreme Court review of their case is pending, a federal judge ruled Monday. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton signed an order shortly after attorneys for Bill Baroni, who had started serving an 18-month sentence in April, filed it. Baroni's attorney Michael Levy confirmed Baroni was released about 3 p.m. Monday. The judge also said Bridget Kelly would not have to report for a 13-month sentence on July 10 for her role in the 2013 scheme, commonly called Bridgegate. Baroni's and Kelly's attorneys sought reprieves in light of the high court's decision Friday to review the case in the fall. The convictions stem from the 2013 closure of lanes to the bridge connecting New Jersey and New York as part of a political payback scheme. Baroni was not initially part of the appeal but has since been permitted to join Kelly's effort to overturn their 2016 convictions. Kelly and Baroni have said they're grateful the Supreme Court is hearing their appeal and are hopeful the court will find no crime was committed. Both Baroni and Kelly had their sentences reduced after an appeals court tossed out civil rights convictions last fall. They were also convicted on wire fraud charges for their role in shutting down the bridge's local lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey, just as the school year was beginning, causing gridlock in the town. Baroni was the deputy executive director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the region's airports, tunnels and bridges, including the George Washington. Kelly served as Christie's deputy chief of staff. She authored a now-infamous email that included the line ""time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" The town's mayor, a Democrat, had declined to endorse Christie, a Republican, for his re-election as New Jersey governor in 2013. Christie was courting Democrats as part of an effort to show he had cross-party appeal. Christie has denied wrongdoing and wasn't charged. Following the developments in the case Friday, Christie said Friday on ABC's ""The View"" that he has always thought the prosecution was political and that no crimes had been committed. The scandal generated negative headlines for Christie and played a role in his failed 2016 presidential campaign, with his rivals using it to attack the two-term governor. Then-candidate Donald Trump, for example, said on the trail that Christie knew about the bridge closure   something Christie always denied. David Wildstein, another former Port Authority official, pleaded guilty and testified for prosecutors during the trial. He was convicted and sentenced to probation and community service, and now operates a New Jersey politics news site. ___ This article has been corrected to show that the former deputy executive director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's last name is Baroni, not Baron.",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
North Korean leader's slain half-brother was a CIA informant: Wall Street Journal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who was killed in Malaysia in 2017, had been an informant for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The Journal cited an unnamed ""person knowledgeable about the matter"" for the report, and said many details of Kim Jong Nam's relationship with the CIA remained unclear. Reuters could not independently confirm the story. The CIA declined to comment. The Journal quoted the person as saying ""There was a nexus"" between the CIA and Kim Jong Nam. ""Several former U.S. officials said the half brother, who had lived outside of North Korea for many years and had no known power base in Pyongyang, was unlikely to be able to provide details of the secretive country's inner workings,"" the Journal said. The former officials also said Kim Jong Nam had been almost certainly in contact with security services of other countries, particularly China's, the Journal said. Kim Jong Nam's role as a CIA informant is mentioned in a new book about Kim Jong Un, ""The Great Successor,"" by Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield that is due to be published on Tuesday. Fifield says Kim Jong Nam usually met his handlers in Singapore and Malaysia, citing a source with knowledge of the intelligence. The book says that security camera footage from Kim Jong Nam's last trip to Malaysia showed him in a hotel elevator with an Asian-looking man who was reported to be a U.S. intelligence agent. It said Ki's backpack contained $120,000 in cash, which could have been payment for intelligence-related activities, or earnings from his casino businesses. South Korean and U.S. officials have said the North Korean authorities had ordered the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, who had been critical of his family's dynastic rule. Pyongyang has denied the allegation. Two women were charged with poisoning Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with liquid VX, a banned chemical weapon, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017. Malaysia released Doan Thi Huong, who is Vietnamese, in May, and Indonesian Siti Aisyah in March. According to the Journal, the person said Kim Jong Nam had traveled to Malaysia in February 2017 to meet his CIA contact, although that may not have been the sole purpose of the trip. U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have met twice, in Hanoi in February and Singapore last June, seeming to build personal goodwill but failing to agree on a deal to lift U.S. sanctions in exchange for North Korea abandoning its nuclear and missile programs.

'Stupidity and selfishness' led to deaths of two patients who drowned in van,"The mother of a woman who drowned in floodwaters while riding in the back of a South Carolina sheriff's office van blamed her death on the ""stupidity and selfishness"" of the two deputies entrusted with her care, and told a judge Friday that ""no amount of justice"" would heal her heart. The family members of Nicolette Green, 43, as well as a second woman who drowned in the van, Wendy Newton, 45, spoke through tears while addressing the court during a bond hearing for the former Horry County deputies. Linda Green, Nicolette's mother, said she is haunted daily by ""the horror"" of her daughter gasping for air as the rising waters trapped her last September in the wake of Hurricane Florence. Both women were mental health patients and being transported to a behavioral center as part of their treatment when the incident occurred. Linda Green said her daughter had been slowly improving after suffering from bouts of schizophrenia, and had willingly gone with the deputies as part of a routine to monitor her medication. ""We, as her family, realized it was helping her and we were getting her back as a daughter, and a mother, and as a sister,"" Linda Green said. ""We were overjoyed at getting her back with us. Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally."" Rose Hershberger, Green's oldest daughter and a senior in high school, lamented about not having her mother during milestones in her life, like picking out a prom dress or her forthcoming graduation. ""Every night is just a constant lack of sleep,"" Hershberger said. ""All I see is my mother, and I hear her screams and her cries."" Cheryl Graham, the associate chief magistrate in Marion County, later responded that ""to say that this is a tragedy is an understatement … May God help us all."" Graham set bond at $30,000 for Stephen Flood, who was charged with two counts each of reckless homicide and involuntary manslaughter, and at $10,000 for Joshua Bishop, who was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Attorneys for the men argued that both are well-respected in the community, had many years of experience with the sheriff's office and not flight risks. Bishop's attorney told the court that his client's wife is due to give birth next month, and that ""his heart hurts every day for what has occurred."" The next hearing date was set for Feb. 26. Both men were fired following the deaths of Green and Newton. While Horry County officials said Flood went around a barrier meant to prevent vehicles from entering hazardous areas, he had been waved through by National Guardsmen. Meanwhile, the women were locked in the back of the van. The deputies said neither could be reached once they realized they were surrounded by floodwaters. Amid the chaos, the van ended up on its side and rested against a guardrail, and the deputies said they were unable to unlock the back door. They waited on the roof of the van until they could be rescued, authorities said.",legal arguments,Associated Press,center
